<h4>Watch the webinar on-demand</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve witnessed machines having very human conversations with generative AI, like ChatGPT—and naturally, contact centers are using this new generative AI technology to humanize their customer experience. The power to improve key metrics like resolution rates and average handle times is unlocked when you combine LLMs with customer data. But, achieving these results at scale requires an enterprise-grade connection to avoid common risks like hallucinations and inaccurate responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paramount Hospitality successfully integrated an LLM layer into their Contact Center Automation platform and securely combined the knowledge of generative AI with their business processes, SKUs and internal systems. The results? A 10% improvement in resolution rates, 30% shorter calls and significantly more flexible and natural conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk away with a fresh blueprint and learn:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Paramount Hospitality navigated their LLM deployment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design, integration and deployment phases of LLM-powered automation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to safely incorporate LLMs with customer data and existing platforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to determine your contact center’s LLM readiness </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to perform a cost-benefit analysis for using LLMs</span></li>

<h4>Watch the webinar on-demand</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT and Large Language Models have the power to revolutionize customer service. And for Replicant’s customers, it’s already happening. Better resolution rates. Fewer turns and lower average handle times. Faster time to value. These are no longer promises, but actual results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more companies have adopted Contact Center Automation as they deal with agent hiring challenges, call volume spikes and budget pressures. LLMs are already accelerating this trend, and companies that don’t act will be left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join Gadi Shamia, co-founder and CEO of Replicant, Meghna Suresh, Head of Product, Replicant, and Tanya Weigelt, AVP, CAA Auto Club to understand how companies are already unlocking the potential of this new technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>While the wine tasting may be over, the takeaways live on&#8230;</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We enjoyed a fantastic wine tasting with Castello di Amorosa, and while we continued to sip our delectable wines, we got to listen to <strong>Ryan Fuerst, VP of Enterprise Project Management from Benefytt Technologies</strong>, a powerful tool for comparing Medicare policies. Here are some of the key takeaways: </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Contact center staffing continues to be a major challenge, especially during seasonal spikes. Automation can help agents focus on more complex tasks.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Thoughtful implementation of AI technology can lead to an increase in revenue. Benefytt saw a 45% increase in lead conversion after using Replicant.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Consistency is crucial in the contact center. By sending calls to Replicant, it&#8217;s possible to accurately forecast how many will need to be handled by live agents.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Last but not least…listening to success stories about seeing such positive ROI and sipping <span class="il">wine</span> at the same time is just a good feeling!</li>
</ul>
