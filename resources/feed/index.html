<h4>Watch the webinar on-demand</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve witnessed machines having very human conversations with generative AI, like ChatGPT—and naturally, contact centers are using this new generative AI technology to humanize their customer experience. The power to improve key metrics like resolution rates and average handle times is unlocked when you combine LLMs with customer data. But, achieving these results at scale requires an enterprise-grade connection to avoid common risks like hallucinations and inaccurate responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paramount Hospitality successfully integrated an LLM layer into their Contact Center Automation platform and securely combined the knowledge of generative AI with their business processes, SKUs and internal systems. The results? A 10% improvement in resolution rates, 30% shorter calls and significantly more flexible and natural conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk away with a fresh blueprint and learn:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Paramount Hospitality navigated their LLM deployment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design, integration and deployment phases of LLM-powered automation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to safely incorporate LLMs with customer data and existing platforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to determine your contact center’s LLM readiness </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to perform a cost-benefit analysis for using LLMs</span></li>

<h4>Watch the webinar on-demand</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT and Large Language Models have the power to revolutionize customer service. And for Replicant’s customers, it’s already happening. Better resolution rates. Fewer turns and lower average handle times. Faster time to value. These are no longer promises, but actual results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more companies have adopted Contact Center Automation as they deal with agent hiring challenges, call volume spikes and budget pressures. LLMs are already accelerating this trend, and companies that don’t act will be left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join Gadi Shamia, co-founder and CEO of Replicant, Meghna Suresh, Head of Product, Replicant, and Tanya Weigelt, AVP, CAA Auto Club to understand how companies are already unlocking the potential of this new technology.</span></p>

<li>Customers don’t want to talk to a machine</li>
<li>Automation can’t resolve customer issues</li>
<li>Automation aims to replace agents</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the confusion, however, thousands of customer experience innovators are already reaping massive benefits from Contact Center Automation. But for those still gathering information for their own organizations’ automation plans, a clear understanding of the solution is imperative.</p>
<p>This guide helps break down the common myths about Contact Center Automation: what it is, what it isn&#8217;t, and the data that shows how automation transforms both agent and customer experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>While the wine tasting may be over, the takeaways live on&#8230;</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We enjoyed a fantastic wine tasting with Castello di Amorosa, and while we continued to sip our delectable wines, we got to listen to <strong>Ryan Fuerst, VP of Enterprise Project Management from Benefytt Technologies</strong>, a powerful tool for comparing Medicare policies. Here are some of the key takeaways: </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Contact center staffing continues to be a major challenge, especially during seasonal spikes. Automation can help agents focus on more complex tasks.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Thoughtful implementation of AI technology can lead to an increase in revenue. Benefytt saw a 45% increase in lead conversion after using Replicant.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Consistency is crucial in the contact center. By sending calls to Replicant, it&#8217;s possible to accurately forecast how many will need to be handled by live agents.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Last but not least…listening to success stories about seeing such positive ROI and sipping <span class="il">wine</span> at the same time is just a good feeling!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>With hiring challenges and unpredictable call volumes on the rise, contact center leaders must look to new solutions to resolve common, high-volume customer service requests so that agents can focus on resolving more complex issues.</strong></p>
<p>Up until now, contact center leaders have relied on IVRs, standalone chatbots, and agent assist technology to help reduce the burden on agents. But, these solutions are no longer enough. They create frustrating and disjointed customer experiences that deflect, rather than resolve support issues. The result? Agents are still left resolving high-volume repetitive cases, while contact centers continue to face rising costs and customers are left on hold.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through how Replicant is more than just a chatbot. You&#8217;ll learn the problem, solution and benefits that Contact Center Automation is addressing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Solve your struggles with inaccurate forecasting, hiring and training for seasonal fluctuations, and overstaffing.</h5>
<p>Contact centers are a critical part of the customer service strategy, but they’re not set up for success.

<p>Here’s what you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How an elastic customer service model leverages AI to help contact centers quickly scale customer service capacity with customer demand</li>
<li>Why contact centers that have elasticity experience lower costs, no hold times, and higher customer satisfaction</li>
<li>How to bring elasticity into your contact center operations</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there’s anything certain in the call center today, it’s that unpredictability is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Forecasting models aren’t able to address sudden and unforeseen changes, such as the 2020 pandemic and its resulting impact. The ability to scale is the key to always meeting customer expectations for seamless, fast, and helpful customer service interactions.</p>
<p><em><strong>You have a few options for scaling your call center, but what’s the best way to do so?</strong></em></p>
<p>Adding more agents is often the first option. But hiring is expensive, slow, Introduction and challenging, especially during labor shortages. There are three other options for scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider</li>
<li>Implement an interactive voice response (IVR) system</li>
<li>Deploy voice artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three methods have a place in call centers and come with their unique advantages and disadvantages. In this guide, you’ll learn how BPO, voice AI, and IVRs differ and understand how to make the right decision for your contact center — and ultimately, your customer experience.</p>
