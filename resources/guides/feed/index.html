										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Whether you&#8217;re an early adopter of Contact Center Automation, or a leader still exploring your options, chances are you&#8217;ve run into one or more of these common misconceptions:</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>With hiring challenges and unpredictable call volumes on the rise, contact center leaders must look to new solutions to resolve common, high-volume customer service requests so that agents can focus on resolving more complex issues.</strong></p>
<p>Up until now, contact center leaders have relied on IVRs, standalone chatbots, and agent assist technology to help reduce the burden on agents. But, these solutions are no longer enough. They create frustrating and disjointed customer experiences that deflect, rather than resolve support issues. The result? Agents are still left resolving high-volume repetitive cases, while contact centers continue to face rising costs and customers are left on hold.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through how Replicant is more than just a chatbot. You&#8217;ll learn the problem, solution and benefits that Contact Center Automation is addressing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there’s anything certain in the call center today, it’s that unpredictability is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Forecasting models aren’t able to address sudden and unforeseen changes, such as the 2020 pandemic and its resulting impact. The ability to scale is the key to always meeting customer expectations for seamless, fast, and helpful customer service interactions.</p>
<p><em><strong>You have a few options for scaling your call center, but what’s the best way to do so?</strong></em></p>
<p>Adding more agents is often the first option. But hiring is expensive, slow, Introduction and challenging, especially during labor shortages. There are three other options for scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider</li>
<li>Implement an interactive voice response (IVR) system</li>
<li>Deploy voice artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three methods have a place in call centers and come with their unique advantages and disadvantages. In this guide, you’ll learn how BPO, voice AI, and IVRs differ and understand how to make the right decision for your contact center — and ultimately, your customer experience.</p>
