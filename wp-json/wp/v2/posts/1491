Providers have an opportunity to turn this around by tapping into voice AI and the benefits that it provides consumers. \u201c[C]onsumers believe AI can increase efficiency and deliver personalized recommendations, through appointment scheduling, health reminders, and cost-saving recommendations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some healthcare providers are already using AI, but there\u2019s still progress to be made. Only <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/news-releases\/u-s-healthcare-leaders-expect-widespread-adoption-artificial-intelligence-2023\/#gs.3bjvq9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">37% of healthcare organizations<\/a> use AI, with widespread uses including clinical application, risk scoring, medication safety warnings, and patient-facing interaction. Yet, 54% believe that AI will be ubiquitous in the healthcare industry by 2023.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/industries\/healthcare\/emerging-trends-pwc-healthcare\/new-entrants-healthcare-provision.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PwC<\/a>, \u201c[a]n era of patient-centric health systems is emerging.\u201d As the healthcare industry shifts away from fragmented care, patients will play a more critical role in decision-making and coordination of care while driving new business models. Like other industries, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/industries\/ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-commerce<\/a> and financial services, healthcare organizations must prioritize the customer experience. Let\u2019s look at some ways that voice AI can help healthcare organizations achieve this.<\/p>\n<h2>24\/7\/365 on-demand access to healthcare<\/h2>\n<p>Along with hurdles such as a disintegrated care model and out-of-date technology, healthcare providers now must manage evolving patient expectations. Healthcare often feels complex and inaccessible. Now, consumers are breaking down these barriers, demanding self-service options that are easy to navigate. For example, 52% are interested in a voice assistant for health tips.<\/p>\n<p>With real-time communication now available through chat and social media, consumers expect the same in healthcare. Younger generations, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/news\/stories\/new-research-reveals-global-consumer-trends-for-healthcare-life-sciences\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millennials and Gen Z<\/a>, will continue to drive this expectation, with 63% valuing instant messaging and 42% demanding video chat. The healthcare industry can step up to provide instantaneous, around-the-clock care by integrating voice AI into its customer service operations.<\/p>\n<h2>Reduced manual data entry leads to more time with patients<\/h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/worldmedicalinnovation.org\/top-12-disruptive-health-care-ai-technologies-announced\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Medical Innovation Forum<\/a>, voice AI is one of the top twelve disruptive healthcare AI technologies, as \u201c[v]oice assistants are being explored for reducing physicians\u2019 data entry burdens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By using speech recognition and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/natural-language-processing-and-the-future-of-voice-in-tech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">natural language processing<\/a>, voice AI can dramatically reduce the time clinicians spend reviewing documentation, such as electronic health records or billing. With healthcare professionals spending approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2021\/03\/03\/the-rise-of-ai-voice-assistants-in-clinical-documentation\/?sh=6c1fbe1d56cc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-third of their time on paperwork<\/a>, voice AI can help healthcare providers, such as clinicians, \u201cdeliver better care and provide more of what matters: quality time with patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Automated appointment management and patient operations<\/h2>\n<p>With voice AI, the healthcare industry can reduce friction with various transactional tasks that happen throughout the patient\u2019s experience. It can offer \u201ceasier ways to book an appointment or check in, [reduce] waiting times, [get] tests results without seeing a doctor or <a href=\"https:\/\/customerthink.com\/how-customer-experience-is-changing-the-healthcare-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24\/7 access to the health information and care<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>AI can also automate insurance eligibility, unadjudicated claims, and outstanding balances. These mundane and repetitive tasks can be handled by voice AI with no errors. This not only improves the patient experience, but it also frees up healthcare workers to focus on patients \u2014 not paperwork. By streamlining healthcare services through voice AI, healthcare providers and other workers can reduce costs associated with care and remove frustrating barriers for patients.<\/p>\n<h2>Increased patient disclosure can reduce readmission<\/h2>\n<p>Voice AI can also increase patient disclosures, which in turn, reduces readmission. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wolterskluwer.com\/en\/about-us\/organization\/health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolters Kluwer<\/a>, which provides \u201ctrusted clinical technology and evidence-based solutions that engage clinicians, patients, researchers, students, and the next generation of healthcare providers,\u201d found this to be true within their own business operations.<\/p>\n<p>The company provides a personalized and interactive voice bot named Emmi. Consumers know they are not speaking to a human agent. But according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcarefinancenews.com\/news\/how-artificial-intelligence-analytics-and-automation-are-reshaping-hospital-revenue-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shara Cohen, vice president of Customer Experience for Clinical Effectiveness<\/a> at Wolters Kluwer Health, this can often be advantageous. For example, Cohen states, \u201c\u2019What we\u2019ve found is patients are willing to disclose embarrassing or sensitive topics to a voice that\u2019s not going to have a reaction.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For one provider using Emmi, \u201c83 percent of patients who disclosed depression to Emmi hadn\u2019t discussed this with their physician.\u201d Also, Emmi\u2019s AI can notify nurses of \u201cpatients who need a follow-up call with a clinician.\u201d It can even go \u201cdeeper into analytics through subsets of information, such as length of time on a call, to predict readmission risk.\u201d Voice AI offers scale to healthcare professionals that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have, while giving patients a user-friendly outlet for frank disclosures.<\/p>\n<p>With voice AI, healthcare workers will predict patients\u2019 needs and concerns better while encouraging patients to take more control of their own health journey. <a
