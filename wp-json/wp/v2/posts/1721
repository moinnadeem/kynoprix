That was up from 4.2 million in October and was the most in the two decades that the government has been keeping track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workforce management (WFM) has never been more difficult for contact centers as the available pool of qualified agents shrinks and the risk of training new employees comes with the possibility they will quickly become dissatisfied with monotonous work and eventually resign.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now, our biggest concern within the call center space \u2013 specifically on reservations \u2013 is the lack of manpower. After the Great Resignation, we hired 2,500 people since May 1st of 2021. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of those, we have already lost 1,300. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So all of that work just to end up with 1,200 people. Now we are facing a need to hire an additional 2,500 people before the start of the summer. Our biggest concern right now is how to get people through the pipeline as fast as possible and make them as productive as possible as soon as they start.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; CX Managing Director, Fortune 500 Airline<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WFM challenges of 2022 are accelerating the need for innovation in the contact center. It\u2019s imperative that every stakeholder in your organization\u2019s customer service operation takes a step back to reassess how they traditionally addressed WFM.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with these five new truths:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Truth #1: Training is more expensive than ever<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.callcentrehelper.com\/images\/resources\/2021\/procedureflow-state-of-the-contact-centre-training-report-whitepaper-210623.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call Centre Helper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over half (55%) of contact centers take 6-12 weeks to fully train and onboard new agents. For these contact centers, nesting costs range from $115,200 &#8211; $345,600, without factoring in costs such as trainer\u2019s salary, HR, costs, or IT costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s worse is the risk of deploying under-trained agents to customer service calls can be just as costly when it comes to retention and branding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers must be judicious about where their hiring budget goes. It\u2019s unfeasible to proceed with normal training budgets and processes in the face of skyrocketing attrition rates. Instead, leaders should look to allocate investments to automation softwares that leverages conversational AI to fully resolve tier-1 requests and make agents\u2019 jobs more engaging and less monotonous. After all, automation that uses conversational AI only needs to be trained once.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Truth #2: Brands are at risk<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bad customer experiences are driving customers away faster than ever. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/consulting\/library\/consumer-intelligence-series\/future-of-customer-experience.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PwC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one in three customers will leave a brand they are loyal to after one bad experience. What\u2019s more frightening for contact centers is that what a customer defines as a poor experience can occur before your agents even get on the phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For understaffed contact centers, queue times have jumped up significantly. When a customer calls in, they can quickly become frustrated with dated IVRs that aim to deflect rather than resolve. Where automation can help brands is by acting as a \u201cfirst line of service\u201d for agents. Rather than simply pointing customers to websites or long queue times, automation can achieve the same resolution that humans can, without straying from your brand\u2019s promise of excellent customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Truth #3: Customer patience has reached all-time lows<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As WFM challenges worsen in contact centers, customers are losing their sympathy. Nearly 80% of American consumers point to speed, convenience, knowledgeable help and friendly service as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/consulting\/library\/consumer-intelligence-series\/future-of-customer-experience.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most important<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> elements of a positive customer experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90% of customers rate an &#8220;immediate&#8221; response as important or very important when they have a customer service question. Customers expect a response from a company within <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2021\/12\/08\/top-5-customer-experience-trends-for-2022\/?sh=457631813a0a\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five minutes or less<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Without an easy-to-reach contact center, your CSAT scores are fighting an uphill battle. That&#8217;s why the benefit of automation that results in zero queue times is impossible to ignore.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Truth #4: Traditional solutions are failing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Record-setting resignation rates have increased the need for labor. But where seasonal or temporary hires would step in to fill the gaps in years past, today\u2019s unprecedented resignation rates are exposing the risks of quick hires. The drawbacks of seasonal or temporary hiring include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying on past KPIs that no longer hold to forecast future and immediate hiring needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunk training costs from hires that have joined in the last year and attrited<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No guarantee of lower AHTs, higher CSAT scores, or lower queue times<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost overruns, sometimes paying for agents to not be online<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harm to your brand promise from lack of control and unpredictability<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Staffing issues in BPOs themselves<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Truth #5: The \u201cinnovation race\u201d is on<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/09\/ai-adoption-skyrocketed-over-the-last-18-months\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 52% percent of companies accelerated their AI adoption plans because of the pandemic. Just about all, 86%, said that AI was becoming a \u201cmainstream technology\u201d at their company in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s because AI-driven automation directly addresses the challenges brought on by the Great Resignation. It performs the jobs of an unlimited number of agents, helps retain your current employees by automating repetitive tasks, gets customers resolution faster than ever, and protects your brand promise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/the-great-resignation-why-your-contact-center-wont-survive-without-automation-2\/\"><img decoding=\"async\"
