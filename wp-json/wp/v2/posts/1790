For contact centers, it\u2019s leading to lower application rates and contributing to higher turnover among agents as the labor pool seeks higher paying work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers, on the other hand, are expecting their dollar to go further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, brands are doing everything they can to keep agents in seats. Recently, Southwest announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/southwest-agrees-pay-raises-customer-171234916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay raises are on the way<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for customer service representatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two years of pandemic-related challenges and unprecedented labor shortages, inflation is yet another wrench in contact centers\u2019 plans to keep customers happy and employees engaged.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also another reason why Contact Center Automation has never been more needed. Contact Center Automation enables customer service departments to completely automate tier 1 support requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Powered by conversational AI, it\u2019s a state-of-the-art solution that provides human-to-machine interactions that customers actually <em>want<\/em> to talk to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can execute an unlimited number of concurrent conversations and provide stellar, consistent experiences across every channel in any language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When paired with the below strategies, it\u2019s a failsafe solution for contact centers to improve their workforce management and empower their agents without sacrificing customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Agent Retention Is Crucial<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer service agents have had a challenging two years. 96% feel <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calabrio.com\/wfo\/workforce-engagement-management\/what-agents-want-in-the-era-of-the-great-resignation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acutely stressed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least once a week. Almost half cite \u2018too many calls\u2019 as their biggest challenge. They\u2019re being asked to manage 7.2 more calls per day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thousands of agents have been a part of the ongoing Great Resignation \u2013 which has seen millions leave unengaging jobs after the pandemic led them to reevaluate what meaningful work is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throw in inflation, and the risk of agents leaving to seek greater fulfillment only increases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike piecemeal contact center solutions like IVRs and agent assist, Contact Center Automation completely offloads the most repetitive, monotonous requests from agents\u2019 plates, while providing rich AI-driven tools that make agents better at their jobs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers using automation are able to free their agents to focus on more engaging conversations that require human creativity and empathy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Agents Must Add Skills<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation has a cascading effect on agents. When tier 1 requests are completely automated, agents gain more time to focus on complex requests. This makes it all the more important they\u2019re armed with the skills and resources to execute multifaceted support issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With less time spent on repetitive tasks and after-call work, contact centers should use automation as an opportunity to focus on professionally developing agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether that means earning certifications or taking analytics courses, contact centers who place an emphasis on development give their agents greater fulfillment. They also add more opportunities for employees to earn higher wages while providing customers with improved service no matter how complicated their requests are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Hiring Is Even More Competitive<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As staff shortages persist, contact centers are faced with the reality that their biggest demand spikes will be met with longer wait times and more stressed out agents. Automation can help. Contact Center Automation acts as a first line of defense for contact centers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can take every call, text, or chat with zero wait times and begin collecting issues and resolving requests at first touch.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation is available 24\/7 and can scale up or down instantly according to your demand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers only play for the minutes where our Thinking Machine is online. When spikes happen and agents are stretched thin, or simply unhirable, automation provides contact centers with a plan that doesn\u2019t tie service capacity to headcount.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Customers Will Continue to Demand More<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When costs rise, customers expect their dollar to stretch further. And that\u2019s on top of recent trends indicating an increasingly cutthroat retention environment. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/customer-service-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce and Bain &amp; Company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a customer is four times more likely to buy from a competitor if the problem is service related rather than price or product related. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a brand to make up for one negative experience, it takes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/customer-service-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12 positive customer experiences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The longtail cost? It costs <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/customer-service-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6-7 times more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to attract a new customer than to retain an existing customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer experiences are the arena where brand loyalty is won or lost. A single day of long wait times, or an individual conversation with misunderstandings and a quick abandonment, are no longer an option. Contact Center Automation brings an unprecedented defense to customers\u2019 most common issues with support, and ensures your brand is positioned to build trust \u2013 not lose it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>ROI For Every Decision<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the coin is the bottom line of your contact center. Investments get even more heavily scrutinized in an inflationary environment. Purchased solutions must be forecastable, quick to deploy, and easy to capture a return on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything, Contact Center Automation offers short and long-term ROI that can save millions of dollars while boosting customer retention rates and capitalizing on upselling\/cross-selling opportunities, all while reducing hiring and training costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation allows contact centers to think critically about their customer patterns and maximum ROI opportunities, rather than focusing on the intricacies of building a solution in-house \u2013 a process that can take months to years to accomplish, and often never is completed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long term, it gives organizations a whole new way to treat contact centers. They will no longer be a cost center but instead shift to centers of excellence able to gain new insights on the customer and their priorities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately contact centers are able to illuminate gaps in other areas of their business with Contact Center Automation, resulting in a 360-degree view of the customer and operating model at large.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Costs Are Rising, But Contact Centers Can Stay Calm Inflation is applying
