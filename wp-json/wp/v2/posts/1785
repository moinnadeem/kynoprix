Contact centers who haven\u2019t moved to adopt an automation solution will likely be regretting it. That\u2019s because first-movers in Contact Center Automation have a distinct advantage over their competitors \u2013 for a few key reasons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation is an emerging category in which companies automate tier 1 customer service while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps augment customer service and allows brands to stand out among consumers by providing always-on, rapid service for everyday questions over any channel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It frees up agents to be more engaged and more available for customers who truly need human assistance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, it allows contact centers to begin reaping the compounding benefits of automation faster than their competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s why contact centers who start using automation now will benefit most, and why those who wait will be kicking themselves six months down the road:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your Competition Is Already Automating<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/09\/ai-adoption-skyrocketed-over-the-last-18-months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 52% percent of companies accelerated their AI adoption plans because of the Covid crisis. 86% say that AI became a \u201cmainstream technology\u201d at their company in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers who adopt automation are making a transformational decision. They\u2019re not simply adding another tool that adds incremental efficiency gains to agent workflows, routing trees, or channel-specific interactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re getting a rapidly deployable platform that completely offloads tier 1 requests from their agents and adds unprecedented analytics that allow managers to make smarter decisions. They\u2019re able to completely eliminate wait times in an era where many brands are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/01\/business\/customer-service-pandemic-rage.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">losing customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to a nationwide agent shortage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com\/tip\/AI-improves-customer-experience-call-center-efficiency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TechTarget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, customer sentiment ratings increased 57.3% among companies using AI in their customer experience initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Implementation Can Take Just Weeks<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation solution comes 80% ready to deploy right out of the box, because it\u2019s purpose-built for customer service. This means that contact centers who begin implementing now don\u2019t need to wait months to go live. They simply have to focus on customizing their solution for their brand\u2019s support conversations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only work needed to deploy Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine is integrating the solution into your systems and personalizing the solution for your business. A weeks-long deployment means that you can start seeing a return on your investment as soon as the Thinking Machine is taking calls.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Agent Wellness Improves Instantly<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation can remove <\/span><b>all<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> repetitive, tier 1 requests from your representatives\u2019 plates. This is an unprecedented value-add for a group of employees that is seen as one of the most stressed in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">83% of agents in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calabrio.com\/wfo\/workforce-engagement-management\/what-agents-want-in-the-era-of-the-great-resignation\/\" target=\"_blank rel=\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cited a lack of data and\/or appropriate tech tools as the largest barrier to resolving customer issues. 96% feel acutely stressed at least once a week. Almost half cite \u2018too many calls\u2019 as their biggest challenge. They\u2019re being asked to manage 7.2 more calls per day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine you\u2019re a contact center agent who has spent years taking wall-to-wall requests every day, with the majority of them being the same question over and over. All of a sudden, you\u2019re completely liberated from these conversations and tasked with only focusing on engaging, creativity-driven requests. That\u2019s the power of Contact Center Automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Your Busy Season Becomes Manageable<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the Great Resignation and pandemic-related spikes in call volumes have made forecasting staff requirements a difficult task. Throw in seasonality for industries like ecommerce, insurance, healthcare, etc., and planning for high demand becomes downright impossible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional solutions like temporary employees and Business Process Outsourcing (BPOs) no longer deliver the value they used to. They\u2019re expensive, come with long training tails, and often lead to scoping and cultural challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation helps managers plan for seasonality by providing a catch-all solution for repetitive use cases \u2013 order updates, requests for documents, account management \u2013 that make up the majority of inbound requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Valuable Datasets Get Built Faster<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably the most important benefit of beginning automation sooner rather than later is the data you\u2019ll begin to build. One reason for this is that automation solutions utilize conversational AI to power interactions. Conversational AI relies on continuous learning models that allow it to get better at conversing with every interaction it has.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another reason is that Contact Center Automation provides user-friendly insights to managers that surface new automation opportunities, unseen customer patterns, and KPIs for every call or chat it takes. Contact centers who are already accruing this data will be able to scale quicker and smarter than their competitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Costs Are Never Out of Your Control<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation platform is elastic, meaning it can scale up infinitely, or be completely offline and cost you nothing while not in use. Contact centers with Replicant in place gain the peace of mind that no spike in requests or shortage of agents will hinder their ability to provide stellar service. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also gain a forecastable ROI that builds a business case to automate further flows, or even replace their IVR as a whole. With every automated flow, ROI builds and contact centers essentially gain a greater pool of cost-effective, predictable tier 1 agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Learn more about how Contact Center Automation is helping customers and contact centers adapt to the new normal by serving the customer, the agent, and the contact center with equal effectiveness.  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/your-checklist-to-survive-the-contact-center-labor-crisis\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7411\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ChecklistToSurviveCCLaborCrisis_2501x469-1024x192.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don&#8217;t Wait, Automate A few years ago, 76% of contact centers were planning to invest&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":1787,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Contact Center Automation: 6 Months From Now, You\u2019ll Wish You Started Today\u00a0 | Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Contact Center Automation is becoming a solution of choice for customer service-centric brands.
