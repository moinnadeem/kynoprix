But like most things, once you get into the details, a well-run call center is much more complex than what it appears to be on the surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/operations\/our-insights\/a-new-growth-story-maximizing-value-from-remote-customer-interactions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McKinsey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, automation can transform the typical cost center into a revenue generator by boosting sales throughout the customer life cycle. Understanding the power of the call center software available today can help organizations make the best decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of Contact Centers\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different types of contact centers include inbound, outbound, outsourced, multi-channel and omnichannel. Each type serves a different objective, and an organization may choose one or more of these at any given time, depending on the company\u2019s highest priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How They Operate<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the type of call center, they can operate in different ways. The most basic ones may simply take inbound customer calls for order placement, problem resolution, or questions. The more sophisticated ones may handle inbound calls through a complex solution incorporating AI software and in-person representatives as well as place outbound calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about Replicant\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/contact-center-automatioin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact center automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Purpose of Each Type of Contact Center<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each type offers a different service. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inbound:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These centers are designed to take new orders, troubleshoot problems, update account information, and collect feedback. Inbound call centers often have unpredictable call volumes, seasonal spikes, and rely on agent availability.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Outbound<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: These types of call centers reach out to prospects or current customers to set appointments, conduct surveys, upsell products, or follow-up on inquiries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Outsourced<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Companies may seek business process outsourcing (BPO) for customer service to meet spikes in seasonal demand. Outsourced centers can handle overflow, reducing caller wait times and frustration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Multi-Channel<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: While individuals still make phone calls for service, many are turning to texting, chatting, or social media posting. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2019-09-25-gartner-says-only-9--of-customers-report-solving-thei\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about 44 percent of people preferred problem resolution by phone, 17 percent by chat, and 15 percent by email. Many companies now use agents to respond to customers through all these channels. However, these inquiries and subsequent responses are siloed by individual channels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Omni-Channel<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: An omnichannel contact center serves customers across all channels and shares information across them, allowing conversations to seamlessly switch between platforms.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do I Choose the Right Type?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice comes down to how it must serve its customers\u2019 needs. For example, small organizations that don\u2019t need to make cold calls would not benefit from a large outbound center. Whichever type of contact center you select, you want to be sure to take the following factors into account:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customer Experience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Customer satisfaction should be the overarching KPI for any program. Solutions that provide 24\/7 availability, minimum hold times, and the right answers increase resolution and containment rates as well as prevent customer frustration and attrition.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Automation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Automation plays a key role. Not only has machine learning technology reached the point where tools like conversational AI can fully resolve customer calls without agent intervention, automation can also classify and route calls more intelligently than traditional interactive voice responses systems.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Agent Empowerment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Happy agents lead to happy customers. Contact centers with greater automation and technology integration mean agents answer fewer redundant calls and spend less time on data entry. This means agents can spend more time on high-empathy calls as well as provide greater business insights into who your customers are and why they call.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Return on Investment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Call centers are often viewed as cost centers and any investments made should strive toward achieving clear business outcomes in both the short and long-term. Select a solution that reduces overhead while increasing productivity. According to an article in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2019\/09\/24\/50-stats-that-prove-the-value-of-customer-experience\/?sh=5476b0a74ef2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 84 percent of companies that work to improve their customer experience report an increase in their revenue.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Solution<\/span><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for a partner that offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/contact-center-automatioin\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact center automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be easily and completely integrated into your business, contact us.
