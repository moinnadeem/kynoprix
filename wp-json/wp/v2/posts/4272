These \u201cfour pillars\u201d \u2013 as the technology consulting and research firm refers to them \u2013 are critical for companies with an ambition \u201cto enhance customer service, create a more seamless customer journey, and better design and direct future journeys,\u201d said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/drew-kraus-426133\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drew Kraus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, VP Analyst at Gartner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four customer service pillars highlighted by Gartner include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting Connected<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process Orchestration<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowledge and Insight<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resource Management<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant, as the industry leader <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/what-is-contact-center-automation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Contact Center Automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has a clear interest in these four pillars and has made strides to incorporate them into Replicant\u2019s platform. The success of Contact Center Automation becomes even more critical when taking a look at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2022-08-31-gartner-predicts-conversational-ai-will-reduce-contac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another recent report from Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that predicts investment in conversational AI will surge to nearly $2 billion this year \u2013 and by 2026, will ultimately reduce contact center agent costs by $80 billion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Getting connected<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pillar is all about \u201ccreating a seamless customer journey across assisted and self-service channels,\u201d according to Gartner, which points to cloud-based technologies as an important avenue to manage customer support and employee engagement. \u201cCloud enables organizations to focus on transforming customer experience (CX), rather than managing the day-to-day technology needs of users,\u201d said Kraus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant tackles this critical pillar <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/omnichannel-contact-center-solutions-that-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through its omnichannel approach<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Not only does the cloud-based platform allow customers to receive support via whatever channel they\u2019re most comfortable with \u2013 whether it be voice, text or chat \u2013 but customers can also switch seamlessly between channels if necessary, without losing context. All customer information from these channels is processed by a single conversation engine that in turn informs automated interactions and resolutions across channels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Process orchestration<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation is the focus of this key pillar, according to Gartner, as automation has improved to the point where supporting increasingly detailed customer needs is not only possible \u2013 but practical for contact centers facing budgetary <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/how-the-great-resignation-is-impacting-contact-centers-in-10-data-points\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and staffing challenges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThe emergence of sophisticated AI voice capabilities have made large-scale call center automation viable, with huge potential for savings and positive CX,\u201d said Kraus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, Replicant\u2019s game-changing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/the-difference-between-conversational-ai-and-chatbots\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approach to conversational AI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been employed to successfully resolve some 30 million customer service requests. Conversational AI allows people to speak or type naturally with a machine without being beholden to limited menu options and keywords. This is achieved through best-in-class conversation design and accurate machine learning and natural language processing models that ensure fast, accurate, and contextual conversations \u2013 that feel as natural as speaking to a human.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Knowledge and insight<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer and operational insights are the driver behind this category highlighted by Gartner. In other words, data and analytics. Gartner presents customer data platforms (CDPs) as an example of the type of software that can help a company unify customer data from multiple sources to better understand behaviors over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant provides <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/contact-center-automation\/features\/dashboard\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an out-of-the-box and customizable dashboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to streamline the process of accessing valuable conversation data as a chief component of the powerful suite of tools to manage Contact Center Automation. Beyond automatically transcribing conversations for future analysis, data is compiled to help reveal key trends about the customer experience. Reasons for contacting support, top-performing conversation flows and frequent escalation issues are just a few of the insights that can be explored through Replicant\u2019s platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot only has Replicant allowed us to scale our call center operations, but it\u2019s given us insights into caller behavior at a much deeper level than we could have expected \u2013 which ultimately helped us improve the customer experience,\u201d said Mikel Bowman, director of customer support operations at ECSI.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Resource Management<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This pillar relates to technology as a means <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/myth-automation-is-bad-for-customer-service-agents-heres-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to enhance and empower employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Improving workforce management by utilizing resources that help enhance employee engagement ultimately creates a stronger customer experience, according to Gartner. But there are also benefits for employees and companies as well, especially as adoption of automation expands in the coming years. Gartner projects that one in 10 agent interactions will be automated by 2026, up from 1.6% today.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/6-key-features-how-to-identify-contact-center-automation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s innovative approach to Contact Center Automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is able to resolve most common customer requests, which frees up agents to handle more complex problems that require a higher level of engagement and empathy. This creates a more meaningful work environment and reduces employee turnover. According to Daniel O\u2019Connell, VP analyst at Gartner, the efficiency gained by using automation to even just capture basic information like names and policy numbers \u201ccould reduce up to a third of the interaction time that would typically be supported by a human agent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about how Contact Center Automation <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/how-contact-center-automation-is-different-from-other-solutions\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a transformative solution for customer service operations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across industries \u2013 and what a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/the-5-minute-roadmap-to-contact-center-automation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">roadmap to automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looks like.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gartner recently published its latest \u201cHype Cycle\u201d for 2022 which identifies key areas driving technology&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":4273,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
