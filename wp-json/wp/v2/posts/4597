ECSI, a leading global payments company, has taken an innovative approach to their contact center. After the pandemic forced agents to work from home and led to impossible to overcome hiring challenges, ECSI partnered with Replicant to deploy Contact Center Automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f to resolve tier 1 requests, their organization has seen incredible results across average handle times, agent call volumes, containment rates and more. But getting there was a learning experience. Mike Bowman, Senior Director, Operations, shared with attendees some of the strategies that drove success and ultimately value throughout their automation implementation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Before getting started, a few core boxes should be checked:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve defined success and what you want to achieve<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve confirmed automation makes sense for your specific business needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ve completed a cost analysis (our handy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/contact-center-automation\/roi-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROI calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a good starting point)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You understand what type of AI to use<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Tip #1: Do Your Research<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CX leaders trying to get educated on AI will undoubtedly run into a lot of bold claims. The buzz around AI requires those in the consideration phase to cut through the noise. An effective way to do this is to go directly to other businesses already using automation to get their honest feedback. \u201cBy far, for us, talking to people who are actually involved in AI is invaluable to determine what\u2019s fact or fiction,\u201d Bowman said.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #2: Start Small<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify low hanging fruit in your processes. Small-scale processes like authenticating a customer are great candidates to test automation without making a large investment. These seconds not only turn into dollars saved, they help businesses learn about the potential of automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n<h2>Tip #3: Get Started Now<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is evolving fast. For CX leaders, determining what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s not is a big step in harnessing the power of automation. Getting started early is the only way to quickly learn the applications of AI in your business. In addition, automation is accelerating the pace of business faster than anything we have ever seen. If you are not using it and your competitor is, you run the risk of falling behind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #4: Understand Your Business Like a SME and a Customer<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An automation deployment is a prime opportunity to get even smarter on your own organizaiton. A thorough business review should bring in SMEs from several departments in order to design a solution that provides the most value. In ECSI\u2019s case, getting the feedback of high performing agents helped them get back what felt like 20 via a well designed Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #5: Engage Your Employees<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educate, don\u2019t eliminate, your workforce. For most agents, AI can seem like a competitor. It\u2019s important to include stakeholders in the process like employees, executives, and clients, from the start. Strategies like focus groups and feedback sessions can help educate employees on what\u2019s in it for them. For example a future without hundreds of password reset requests a day opens up opportunities for agents to reimagine what they\u2019d like to focus on more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #6: Staff Appropriately<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenges around finding employees don\u2019t appear to be going anywhere soon. For contact centers looking to bring on staff to oversee new technologies, it can be helpful to look internally and invest in the education of their star performers instead of hiring externally. Close collaboration with an automation partner can also help staff learn new strategies in real-time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #7: Capitalize On The Brains &amp; The Brawn of Contact Center Automation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation works relentlessly. It moves fast, makes very few mistakes and never misses a call. \u201cIt\u2019s that great,\u201d said Bowman. But on the other side is the brains \u2013 analytics. With automation, contact centers gain efficient insights into problems, issues that aren\u2019t getting fixed, or flows that are broken across your customer experience. This saves hours of manual and anecdotal work while making it easy to improve scripts and augment CX.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Impact of Automation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using these tips and strategies, ECSI deployed and scaled the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f to handle calls across three of their most common requests within a year. After looking at their contact center as a whole during their busiest season year over year, the results spoke for themselves. ECSI\u2019s average speed of answer was 6x faster in summer 2022 than the year prior, despite an increase in total volume. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, all-in costs in total technology and labor cost decreased by nearly 14%. The Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f contained 25% of total inbound calls and shortened 65% of calls while providing additional business intelligence. Today, ECSI no longer has to hire seasonal staff while they\u2019re able to<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upskill their service staff for analyst, CX, and paraprofessional positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/resources\/events-webinars\/resolve-rewind\/\">Watch the full session of Getting Started with Automation plus dozens more on-demand with Resolve Rewind.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!---[CTA] Watch the on-demand session \u201cAnatomy of a Conversation\u201d from Resolve 2022 with Replicant Co-founder and CTO, Benjamin Gleitzman, and Head of Product, Meghna Suresh.---><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most illuminating sessions at Resolve 2022 came from Replicant customer ECSI.
