Contact centers dealing with an increased number of customer questions and inquiries in concert with these staffing challenges struggle to deliver the level of customer experience that consumers desire.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more organizations are turning to automation to help relieve some of these stresses, and implementing a conversational AI platform is one effective way to do that. The best conversational AI platforms can resolve customer questions and requests with zero wait time and without human intervention, providing analytics and continuous learning capabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a conversational AI platform?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conversational AI platform is a form of artificial intelligence technology that supports today\u2019s modern contact center. This AI technology works to answer and resolve Tier One customer questions that tend to be repetitive and mundane in nature automatically without human intervention. Ideally, it is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/contact-center-automation\/features\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">omnichannel solution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that incorporates voice, text, and chatbots in an integrated system to work seamlessly for both the customer and the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does conversational AI work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI platforms such as Replicant are trained on millions of customer interactions each day and can continue to learn and improve with every conversation. They should be able to understand natural language and multiple customer intents as well as a wide variety of other languages, making it as easy as possible for customers to communicate with a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Never-Ending Learning<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most challenging components of running a contact center today is the level of training required for live agents to get up to speed on a business\u2019s products, services, and common questions. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.screensteps.com\/the-true-cost-of-training-a-new-agent-in-the-call-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ScreenSteps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many call centers report their average time to new agent proficiency is four to six months. When you consider that a call center agent stays at the same company for an average of only three years as reported by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abetteranswer.com\/blog\/2015\/10\/employee-stats-in-the-call-center-world\/#:~:text=Then%20you%20have%20a%20pretty,job%20is%20about%203%20years. target=\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Better Answer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, those training costs can quickly add up over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s conversational AI technology is purpose-built for customer service, designed to excel at understanding diverse populations and collecting standard information like names, alphanumeric strings, and unstructured data. It has and continues to automate millions of calls each month and applies continuous machine learning to improve every interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such a solution will never \u201cquit,\u201d requiring you to start the entire training process again. Replicant\u2019s conversational AI solution will continue to change and grow with your organization, becoming an ongoing and valuable \u201cmember\u201d of your team and offering infinite scalability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A Growing Trend<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation powered by conversational AI is on the rise in contact centers around the country. According to Replicant\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/benchmark-report-contact-center-automation-is-moving-to-the-mainstream\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2022 Benchmark Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, around 95 percent of contact center managers have either already adopted or are planning to implement automation within the next year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing superior customer service and supporting overwhelmed live agents, conversational AI can deliver a wealth of contact center analytics to your management team, providing the foundation to help you grow and improve in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI is particularly suited for industries that receive a high number of repetitive inquiries. For example, the travel, hotel, and hospitality industry process millions of requests for new, updated, and canceled reservations. The insurance industry also receives similar requests for account updates, policy information requests, or coverage changes. Financial institutions can provide account balances, payment data, and contact information updates through a conversational AI platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A solution such as Replicant can quickly process these requests with zero hold time and no live agent assistance, which means that even during peak periods, customers have a positive, rapid, and complete experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Try Replicant<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are ready to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/request-a-demo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automate your call center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, reach out to Replicant today.
