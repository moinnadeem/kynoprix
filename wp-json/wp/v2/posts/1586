And for everyone, continued <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/overcome-the-contact-center-crisis-with-conversational-ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pandemic and workforce challenges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will compound holiday-related contact center traffic like we\u2019ve never seen before.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, fortunately, there are many approaches to ringing in the busy season efficiently, and digitization and automation should be at the core of contact center leaders\u2019 strategy. This year, keep your customers happy, hold times to a minimum, and your customer service agents empowered with a well thought-out strategy that minimizes rather than exacerbates the impacts of seasonality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 5 ways to navigate this year&#8217;s seasonality for your contact center.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b><\/b>1. Make self-service clear<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-service options like apps, FAQ pages and chatbots are only as good as your customers\u2019 ability to find \u2013\u00a0and navigate \u2013 these resource. Make your self-service options clear wherever a customer may start, and don\u2019t limit them to just online or app-based resources. Customers still prefer the phone as a service option and a strong omnichannel self-service strategy makes this option easy to find for all customers \u2013 not just those who navigated to the Help Center on your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip: <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI solutions allow customers to resolve 100% of their tier-1 issues naturally over the phone, without having to navigate rigid IVR menus just to be rerouted to your website to find answers. Conversational AI improves CSAT and ensures hold times don\u2019t lead to customer attrition by answering every call. And when escalations do occur, it can initially authenticate customers, schedule an outbound call or collect call summary notes before handing off to an agent and more to make the most out of your customers\u2019 and agents\u2019 time.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>2. Reserve agents for the most important calls<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review\u2019s \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-trends\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 New Call Center Trends &amp; Predictions for 2021\/2022<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d found the pandemic has created 68% more call escalations, 50% more difficult calls and 34% longer hold times. The frustration felt by customers is just as impactful on agents. Not only are they required to resolve complex customer concerns, they often must do so while balancing their routine, day-to-day tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maximize your agents\u2019 ability to provide empathy and understanding to customers, take the burden of tier-1 calls off their plates. An investment in conversational AI automates all tier-1 requests with faster resolution times and higher CSAT scores than any other solution, and allows live agents to focus completely on issues only humans can properly understand. The result? Higher retention rates and satisfaction among both customers and agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Outsource wisely\u00a0<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with a BPO in your back pocket for \u201cpredictable\u201d high call volumes, forecasting challenges will persist. Unless a BPO is your full-time contact center operation, seasonal usage often includes cost overruns due to large training demands and idle agent capacities when overstaffed. While BPOs can greatly reduce hold times and add more available support hours, today\u2019s modern technologies can do the same without any guesswork or cost unknowns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Tip:<\/strong> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI is like having thousands of your best agents on call 24\/7 for your customers \u2013 and you only need to train it once. Its flexible capacity means you can leverage it when you need it and only pay for what you use. Conversational AI also adds out-of-the-box PCI compliance, HIPAA compliance, and security and redundancies at every step so you don\u2019t have to worry about outages or limitations around what types of requests you\u2019re allowed to use it for.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/the-great-resignation-why-your-contact-center-wont-survive-without-automation-2\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7198\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheGreatResignation_2501x469-2-1024x192.png\" alt=\"Download The Great Resignation: Why Your Contact Center Won't Survive Without Automation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4. Make the most of your conversation data<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While seasonality presents a complex contact center challenge, there is also opportunity in the rich data conversations that your customers provide. During periods of high call volumes, do everything you can to capture fully transcribed customer conversations and be prepared with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/dashboard\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">modern dashboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allows you to discover key trends among your customers.

This year has presented challenges unlike anything contact centers have seen before. The conversation data you capture this year can produce insights that will improve your seasonal strategy into next year.
