GDP <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.conference-board.org\/research\/us-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contracted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by -1.4% in Q1, and is currently expected to be only 2.3% for the year. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg survey estimates a 30% chance of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-06-03\/corporate-america-is-sounding-the-alarm-on-the-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recession<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the next 12 months, up from 15% in March.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our corner of the world, many are wondering what a recession would mean for contact centers. On the heels of the pandemic and its ensuing challenges (the Great Resignation, supply chain snags, etc.) the last thing contact centers need is further instability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But fortunately, economic challenges offer something that the pandemic did not: precedent. Using learnings from past markets and consumer behaviors, contact centers can better navigate a potential downturn and come away stronger than before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what a prolonged economic drawback would mean for contact centers, and how they can still position themselves for growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Consumer Spending Will Slow<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With rising interest rates and new home buying expected to fall, some economists think consumer spending has peaked following a long streak of growth. On the business side, capital investment is down, as well as spending on R&amp;D.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the event that customer dollars become harder to earn throughout the summer and into the fall, contact centers will have an outsized impact on company revenues in 2022. Customers have always been quicker to leave brands that offer subpar support and service. One in three customers will <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/future-of-cx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leave a brand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they are loyal to after one bad experience. On the other hand, increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase profits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 25% to 95%, part of the reason why customer loyalty will be contact centers\u2019 biggest asset.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>But Customer Loyalty Will Drive Resilience<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Great Recession of 2009, companies deemed \u201cCX leaders\u201d saw a 6.1% rise in cumulative returns despite the S&amp;P 500 tumbling over 15%. On the other hand, brands deemed \u201cCX laggards\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jonpicoult\/2020\/01\/07\/the-best-business-strategy-for-surviving-a-recession\/?sh=5510820769b0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fell<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> close to 60%. This striking difference is a testament to the value of strong customer experiences in driving loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When customers have immediate access to resolve issues when it&#8217;s most convenient to them, they\u2019re less likely to cancel an order, pause a subscription, or abandon brands as a whole. And when customers receive a consistent, personalized experience across channels and can speak to an agent faster, they\u2019re more likely to stick with a product or service \u2013 even through a recession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Investments Will Be Met With Scrutiny<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a constrained market, it&#8217;s not just consumers who reevaluate their spending habits. Many, if not all, companies also cut budgets, often slashing innovation and technology investments in favor of a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. Additionally, recent hiring challenges in call center agents may push companies to reduce overall investment in their contact centers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidence from past recession cycles shows that companies who identify savings opportunities earlier in a declining market are more resilient. A Harvard Business Review <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/what-companies-should-do-to-prepare-for-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that in the first quarter of 2008, resilient companies had already cut operating costs 1%, even as their sector\u2019s year-on-year costs were growing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A potential recession will mean that contact center leaders must be prepared to justify investments with strong ROI models that show clear paths to savings. Luckily, there\u2019s plenty of proof that supports continued innovation investment in a recession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>But Leaders Won\u2019t Pause Innovation<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While investments will be under the microscope, savvy companies will continue \u2013 if not increase \u2013 their innovation plans through the duration of a recession. For contact centers, this is motivated by evidence that customer loyalty leads to more recession-proof balance sheets. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/01\/are-you-undervaluing-your-customers?ab=at_art_art_1x1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HBR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, loyalty leaders grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. Conversely, 76% of consumers say a poor customer service experience <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/survey-the-effects-of-bad-customer-service-and-how-brands-can-fix-it\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">negatively impacts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their perception of a brand and one in three says it affects loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After decades of stagnant contact center solutions like IVRs, standalone chatbots, and agent assist tools, leaders will use an economic downturn as an opportunity to reevaluate their current tech stacks. By investing earlier in innovation, these companies will not only be more resilient, but more competitive when the market comes back.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Contact Center Automation Will Become Mainstream<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation \u2013 the most rapidly growing contact center solution \u2013 is a modern technology that addresses <strong>every customer service obstacle associated with a recession<\/strong>.
