It&#8217;s built for not only the \u201chappy path\u201d conversations but the edge cases that can lead to frustrating experiences. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result: frictionless experiences that don&#8217;t simply deflect customers but fully resolve requests to drive operational efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few ways Replicant\u2019s gets the most out of Contact Center Automation by creating conversations that customers love.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>9 Game-Changing Conversation Design Tips:<\/h2>\n<p><!---[CTA] Watch the on-demand session \u201cAnatomy of a Conversation\u201d from Resolve 2022 with Replicant Co-founder and CTO, Benjamin Gleitzman, and Head of Product, Meghna Suresh.---><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Answer Immediately &amp; Avoid Personification <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two things that can frustrate a customer in the first few seconds of a call. The first is long wait times. The second is the unnecessary personification of a machine. Replicant avoids both by answering every call immediately and being upfront with customers by stating \u201cI\u2019m a Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f on a recorded line,\u201d and not masking automation with human names or pleasantries. Both factors help gain customers\u2019 trust without wasting their time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Think Like a Machine &amp; What\u2019s In It For Me?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Decades of clunky call trees have conditioned customers to be skeptical of automation. That\u2019s why Replicant designs each Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f to demonstrate value to customers as soon as possible. For example, if a customer attempts to zero-out to speak to an agent, the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f can make a data dip into a call center system to pull a live wait time. From there, it can tell the customer their request can be resolved by the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f before they\u2019d get through to an agent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Natural Language Intents &amp; Colloquial Language <\/b>The last ten years have seen massive technological advancements that allow for better automatic speech recognition than ever. The Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f is designed to match unstructured speech to intents where older solutions get lost in translation. It can understand that a customer saying \u201cI&#8217;ve been squinting at the computer screen and getting headaches\u201d suggests they are seeking an eye exam, or that a customer who says they\u2019re in the \u201cBig Apple\u201d is talking about New York.<\/p>\n<p><b>4. Probabilistic Funnels &amp; Knowledge Based Matching <\/b>Most contact centers have highly probable call paths. When this is the case, it makes sense to build them directly into the Thinking Machine\u2122. For example, if 70% of customers call to ask about contact lenses, it shave valuable seconds off of handle times to lead with \u201cAre you looking for contact lenses?\u201d Conversely, if the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f sees that a customer recently inquired about glasses, it can lead with \u201care you calling about eyeglasses?\u201d to begin making progress faster.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. Conversation Repair <\/b>Sometimes customers change their minds. A caller scheduling an eye exam may initially request an appointment at the Flatiron clinic before realizing that it\u2019s more convenient for them to go to the West Village location. Replicant builds in a \u201cback button\u201d into every Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f to ensure that conversations don\u2019t fall off the rails the second a customer makes a non-linear request.<\/p>\n<p><b>6. Powers &amp; Slot Filling &amp; Contextual Carryover <\/b>There are infinite ways for customers to say the same thing. This can be seen especially in the selection of specific appointment times. A customer may say \u201csometime around 10am works well for me,\u201d but not offer a preferred day. The Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f can react off the time to say, \u201cOkay, I can make a 10am appointment for you, which day do you prefer?\u201d without forcing the customer to rephrase their request.<\/p>\n<p><b>7. Reduce Customer Effort <\/b>When designed with the customer in mind, Powers can go beyond intent detection to reduce customer effort by detecting contextual information. For example, instead of reading back an inbound caller\u2019s phone number, Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f can log a new number and simply ask \u201cis this the best phone number to reach you?\u201d Maximizing simple answers further reduces handle times and creates a frictionless conversation.<\/p>\n<p><b>8. Purpose-built Natural Language Understanding <\/b>NLU models play a key role in the accuracy of the Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f. In a flow like email collection, things can get complicated quickly. Replicant has designed it\u2019s NLU stack to go beyond simple transcription solutions that have long struggled to discern accurate information from alphanumeric strings. For example, it can accurately collect a unique email readout to know that \u201cM as in Mary dot R I L E Y @gmail.com\u201d is \u201cm.riley@gmail.com.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>9. Omnichannel Experience &amp; Conversational Continuation <\/b>After designing these layers of complexity into a voice experience, the next step is filtering a great experience into every channel. The Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f is built to serve every customer in the channel they reached out over, or switch between channels when convenient. For example, a customer can be given the option to receive an appointment confirmation over SMS, while remaining on the phone to refill a prescription.<\/p>\n<p><!---[CTA] Watch the on-demand session \u201cAnatomy of a Conversation\u201d from Resolve 2022 with Replicant Co-founder and CTO, Benjamin Gleitzman, and Head of Product, Meghna Suresh.---><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contact Center Automation is a sophisticated customer service solution powered by a combination of advanced&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":4293,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
