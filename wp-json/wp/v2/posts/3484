Technology has introduced new channels. Customers have increased their expectations. And global events have fundamentally changed how contact centers operate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all these changes, one priority has remained steadfast: Cost Per Call.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost Per Call (CPC) can be defined as the total operational and capital expenditures needed, on average, for a contact center to complete a customer service call. Today, that formula has been expanded to include new channels like chat, email, and text in a total Cost Per Contact metric.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both measures of CPC provide an indicator as to how much a brand spends on customer service, and how associated\u00a0 costs rise and fall over time. An above-average CPC may suggest customer service is weighing down a brand\u2019s bottom line, or that customers are experiencing too many unresolved requests. On the other hand, an abnormally low CPC may suggest a contact center is operating with outdated tools or resources, and needs greater investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In either case, calculating and monitoring a contact center\u2019s Cost Per Call can be a valuable exercise. But a nuanced approach to the metric can help further modernize how brands view the value of their contact center.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Calculating Cost Per Call<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to define CPC as simply the total cost of running a contact center divided by the total number of customer interactions over a given period. But the complexity of modern customer service requires a widened definition of \u201ccost.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The all-up investment brands make in customer service starts with the cost of hiring, training and retaining agents. This may include recruitment campaigns, outsourcing premiums, and incentive-based compensation. To enable agents, brands also spend on hardware and software, management teams, training, and operational costs both for on-premise workers and remote employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cxtoday.com\/contact-centre\/how-to-calculate-your-cost-per-inbound-outbound-call-and-why\/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Good%20Cost%20Per%20Call%3F,indirect%20labour%2C%20and%20operational%20expenses.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CXToday<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, industry benchmarks suggest that an acceptable CPC could range anywhere between $2.70 \u2013 $5.60, including direct labor, indirect labor, and operational expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the biggest pitfall of the CPC metric is that it runs the risk of oversimplifying the goal of contact centers. While benchmarks and averages can provide helpful guidelines as to what a \u201cgood\u201d CPC is, the truth is there is no golden number.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CPC metrics vary wildly across contact centers, depending on their industry, value proposition, size and even time of year. As such, contact center leaders shouldn\u2019t spend too much time trying to find out what their magic number is or should be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, they should divide the \u201ccost\u201d portion of the formula into specific investment buckets and define clear goals for each. In doing so, contact centers can gain a clearer picture of where their operating costs go, and whether or not they\u2019re helping them find their sweet spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Cost Per Call sweet spot<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an individual contact center, a healthy CPC is one that can demonstrate an improving return on investment \u2013 no matter what that number is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If that number is higher than in previous periods, it should be verifiable that your agents are better resourced with top-of-the line tools and that customers are receiving improved service. A higher CPC can also be backed up by improved revenue generation metrics for each call, or lower customer churn rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any additional CPC cost should target these priorities:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving service (and thus lowering churn or increasing revenue)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasing agent retention\/productivity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowering a secondary or associated cost<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving operational efficiency\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These investments may include those that make it easier to offer customers upsells, or increase the speed at which you follow up with prospective customers. In competitive industries like insurance or travel &amp; hospitality, missing these opportunities can add up to millions of dollars of unrealized revenue each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In industries like retail or subscription-based commerce, where customer experience is often a key differentiator for brands, a single poor service experience can be enough for customers to cancel an order or change brands. Any investment made into a contact center should first have a clear path to increasing or retaining customer spend.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, any investment that increases employee retention or lowers hiring costs can lower the overall investment made in recruitment, thus balancing out a contact center\u2019s total budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of today\u2019s modern solutions have the potential to decrease<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CPC by lowering long-term spend in several areas. Those solutions and strategies are discussed below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How to lower Cost Per Call without sacrificing service:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Invest in automation. <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-contact-center-automation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows companies to automate their most common customer service calls while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.

When they do, they can avoid the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/why-siloed-automation-strategies-fail\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costly pitfalls<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> associated with a siloed approach to customer service channel improvement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Personalize based on customer history. <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/consistency-the-key-to-omnichannel-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalized omnichannel experiences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can delight customers, lower Average Handle Time, decrease abandonments, and improve upsells and renewals.
