From the pandemic, to agent shortages, to rising unpredictability in call volumes, there\u2019s never been a more difficult time to manage a customer service organization.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, many leaders are preparing for yet another potential risk on the horizon: a recession. But whether or not the economic turmoil predicted by many experts ever comes to fruition, one thing is clear: the value of future-proofing your contact center is priceless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact center leaders, becoming future-proof means being prepared for dramatic swings in customer demand, agent capacities, and global challenges like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/what-inflation-means-for-contact-centers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inflation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 all without compromising costs, productivity or customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being future-proof goes beyond digital transformation. The latter is often a years-long process that involves several implementation cycles and sometimes hiring entire teams to build new solutions in-house. Instead, leaders are turning to Contact Center Automation, an emerging category in which companies automate their most common customer service calls while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It quickly establishes modern processes that make it as simple as possible to achieve a few steadfast priorities associated with being future-proof, including customer loyalty, agent retention, customer satisfaction, and scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how Contact Center Automation strengthens brands\u2019 position against economic challenges, technology challenges, and above all, the future:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Priorities for contact centers during the prospect of a recession<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>1. Decrease customer churn and increase loyalty<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer spending in 2022 may have already peaked following a strong streak of growth. But contact centers shouldn\u2019t write off the value of customer relationships just because buyers may become more selective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though a company\u2019s first instinct in a downturn is often to cut contact center spending, doing so at the expense of excellent service decreases your chances of maintaining customer loyalty through the duration of a recession. According to Harvard Business Review, increasing customer retention rates by just 5% <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases profits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 25% to 95%, and loyalty leaders <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/01\/are-you-undervaluing-your-customers?ab=at_art_art_1x1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow revenues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Contact Center Automation, customer loyalty can be increased quicker than you might think. In one case, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/customer\/doordash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DoorDash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> partnered with Replicant to deploy a Thinking Machine to fulfill customer orders and prevent cancellations. In just three months, the Thinking Machine was 94% as effective as their previous offshore agents at fulfilling customer orders.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Increase agent retention<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact centers, delivering loyalty-worthy service requires that human agents are in the loop for complex customer requests, or calls that require high empathy. However, despite a tightening economy, there is still a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/did-us-consumer-spending-just-hit-its-peak\/2022\/05\/27\/1694153e-dddb-11ec-bc35-a91d0a94923b_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surplus of open jobs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the wake of the Great Resignation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent the attrition of even more talented agents, contact centers should focus on creating more engaged employees, which are 87% <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/Deloitte\/us\/Documents\/human-capital\/us-cons-engaging-the-workforce.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to leave their organizations (it also costs $9,000 a year to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/351545\/great-resignation-really-great-discontent.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keep<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a disengaged worker and up to $100,000 to replace them).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation offers a hybrid approach to workforce management, where intelligent machines immediately resolve tier 1 issues, while handing off complex issues to agents. This can have a massive impact on employee retention rates by removing the need for agents to handle hundreds of repetitive calls a day, and empowering them to focus on calls that require creativity and critical thinking.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2705 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/checklist-10-steps-to-recession-proofing-a-contact-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Checklist: 10 Steps To Recession-Proofing A Contact Center\u00a0<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>3.
