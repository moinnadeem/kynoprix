BPO allows you to reduce hold times, manage high call volumes, expand call center hours, and scale rapidly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What type of BPO do I need?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many types of Both in-person and AI-driven BPOs are available today. They span several business departments, and can vary in pricing models. Common pricing models include hourly, performance-based, or a hybrid model. Depending on your particular situation, you may want to use one or a combination of many. BPOs can offer cheaper operations, eliminate the need for an internal call center, and provide 24\/7 support.
