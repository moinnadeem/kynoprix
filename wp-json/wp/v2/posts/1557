Here\u2019s what you should know.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What customer service leaders should know<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of total experience leads to better results for the customer, as they\u2019re provided a more comprehensive selection of digital channels to choose from.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, more empowered employees under a TX approach means greater availability and better conversations for customers who need to interact with an agent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase both employee and customer retention by investing in multiexperience technologies to improve user experiences across channels, devices, touchpoints and interaction modalities. -Gartner Recommendations<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This experience-driven agenda for technology investments is key, according to Gartner. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking into account every touchpoint of a customer-employee relationship, businesses develop digital initiatives that increase confidence in customers and employees and drive satisfaction and loyalty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In customer service, this means more productive agents and, in turn, better served customers.\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking it one step further, TX should also leverage data and analytics to remove barriers between shared customer-employee experiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a customer experience leader is able to use technology to surface real-time insights about trending customers requests in a given period, they can quickly develop channels to automate certain flows or make more agents available for tier-2 and above requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/will-ai-replace-contact-center-agents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will AI Replace Contact Center Agents?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What workforce management leaders should know<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workforce management challenges have grown in tandem with rising customer demands. For employee experience leaders, it can be difficult to see down the digital transformation roadmap when staffing against customer uncertainty is blocking the way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A global talent shortage creates a major obstacle to fulfilling the top priorities of CEOs: growth and a notable increase in, and focus on, technology-related and workforce areas. A total experience strategy would connect customers and employees, supported by technologies and multiple modalities. -Gartner<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact centers in particular, TX means empowering agents to connect with customers more directly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be achieved with experience-driven solutions that automate tier-1 customer conversations and allow employees to focus on more engaging interactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key for workforce management leaders is finding an automation solution that can make this happen <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> maintain or even improve customer satisfaction scores at the same time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the employee, TX innovation should also make their technology interactions more seamless. A solution shouldn\u2019t just offload tasks, but work alongside agents to execute intelligent conversation handoffs and generate work orders, tickets, or automated summaries when there\u2019s crossover between employees and automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee experience leaders can use TX to provide a framework. They can join CX leaders in advocating for the customer, while ensuring that any investment takes into account the employee as an equally important stakeholder.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why every business leader should care<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner\u2019s strategic planning assumption is that \u201cBy 2026, 60% of large enterprises will use total experience to transform their business models to achieve world-class customer and employee advocacy levels.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether CX or EX has undergone more growth \u2013 or seen more challenges \u2013 at your organization, it\u2019s easy to see how recent market challenges are bringing the two worlds together.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isolating the customer from the employee from a technology standpoint may make sense on a departmental level, but as the world shifts more rapidly every year to a digital ecosystem, the pain points of siloed strategies will only grow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gartner.com\/document\/code\/757234\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top Strategic Technology Trend for 2022<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, TX affords leaders the best opportunity to explore modern technologies that focus on reducing friction at every turn of a customer journey and every interaction an employee has with technology.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As business leaders look toward 2022, the call for digital transformation has never been louder.\u00a0&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":1558,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What is Total Experience (TX)?
