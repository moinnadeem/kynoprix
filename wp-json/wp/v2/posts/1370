Hearing \u201cwe\u2019re experiencing unexpectedly high call volumes\u201d is not comforting for those needing immediate assistance.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s an old saying that if you want to fix something, you need to drag it out into the sunlight. Well, Covid-19 has done just that.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s exposed where we need to revamp our businesses to keep up with the \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/call-center-next-norm\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">next normal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some ways that the pandemic has highlighted the need to revamp contact centers around the globe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2>There\u2019s No Planning For Unpredictability<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to 2020, contact centers had a pretty good grasp on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/3-ways-conversational-ai-can-help-contact-centers-recover-from-covid-19\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spikes in customer demand<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as those occurring during natural disasters or around seasonal events, like summer vacations or the holidays. However, traditional spikes in demand and service are typically short-lived and often predictable, unlike the new (and continuing) changes in demands created by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising request volumes have coincided with unprecedented labor shortages. Contact centers are left in a place where they can\u2019t predict daily demand or agent headcounts \u2013 let alone both.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping this in mind, contact centers must realize that Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on contact centers, no matter their size or industry. With increased volumes in requests and fewer human reps to handle them because of furloughing or downsizing, companies should begin implementing changes now to stay on pace with their competition.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2>Hybrid Models Are Here to Stay<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic challenges. Dynamic workforces. Dynamic models. Change and flexibility will continue to be themes within every contact center. Entire departments have been moved to remote work locations, and are continuing to do so even as employees are allowed back on-site. This is no easy task. Companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.t-mobile.com\/news\/tex-covid-response-callie-field-blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T-Mobile<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have moved large numbers of contact center employees off-campus to remote, home-based locations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within 20 days, T-Mobile moved 12,000 customer care employees out of 17 call centers to work-from-home platforms. To make sure these skilled employees didn\u2019t miss a beat, T-Mobile rolled out VPN access to these employees along with a larger capacity server and remote collaboration tools, like Slack and Skype, allowing their employees to continue connecting with each other while <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/04\/supporting-customer-service-through-the-coronavirus-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tapping into the knowledge and skills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of their teammates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s another hybrid model coming to the rescue for agents. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-contact-center-automation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact Center Automation<\/a>, which is an emerging category in which companies automate tier 1 customer service while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2>Agents Need More Than Just Moral Support\u00a0<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, companies that move some or all of their contact center employees to remote work must make sure that they don\u2019t just have access to company infrastructure and technology platforms, but they also need to provide these employees with continual knowledge and tools to perform their jobs remotely, ultimately delivering continued customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need for new skills is not a new topic in the workplace, but it may become a top priority in a world that has seemingly changed overnight. According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/02\/making-learning-a-part-of-everyday-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Journal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, opportunities for continued development is the second most important factor for employees\u2019 happiness, just behind the nature of the work itself.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, according to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcvelocity.com\/articles\/45924-executive-survey-majority-of-scaled-down-call-centers-lack-necessary-knowledge-resources-to-help-re\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 56.7% of companies reported that they \u201cneeded to find ways to provide remote call center staff with knowledge they need to remotely answer questions.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, companies need to consider updating pre-Covid scripts and procedures in light of new challenges, allowing employees to step out from behind policies and offer effective resolutions in this new day. With customer service calls becoming <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/04\/supporting-customer-service-through-the-coronavirus-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more complex<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in light of the pandemic, companies need to prioritize their employees, reducing these pandemic-related challenges experienced in the customer service industry.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2>How to Navigate the Road to Automation<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do contact center agents need access to internal infrastructures, collaboration tools, and updated procedures and scripts, but they also need an effective way to increase productivity by removing repetitive tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implementing or upgrading your contact center with artificial intelligence and automation via is one way to not only elevate agent productivity but also shorten hold time and resolve issues faster to increase customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the implementation of automation doesn\u2019t occur in a silo. To be truly effective and flexible, the collaboration between human agents and technology is critical, as it elevates your productivity and scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, virtual agents are an efficient way to handle repetitive calls, such as placing orders, entering payment information, or changing an address for an order. Further, a virtual agent is \u201con\u201d all day, every day, allowing you to handle higher request levels quickly and efficiently, while scaling up or down to meet demand.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By removing these mundane, repetitive, tier 1 customer service cases from the task sheet of your human agents, you allow them to focus on more complex issues, needing human interaction or creative problem solving.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with fewer human agents currently working because of the pandemic, virtual agents, AI, and automation can beneficially step into that gap, filling it with fast, efficient responses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/martechseries.com\/mts-insights\/interviews\/martech-interview-with-gadi-shamia-ceo-at-replicant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while reducing inefficiencies around repetitive work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies can tackle the personal and business challenges of their customers by focusing on meaningful investments in customer service call centers, such as moving the center to a cloud-based platform, allowing their agents to work from home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with AI-tools, contact centers can triage calls, giving customers immediate relief, while sending the conversations requiring complex, creative analysis to live agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By elevating your employees to a more satisfying, challenging job, you\u2019ll not only increase your employees\u2019 satisfaction, but you\u2019ll see your retention numbers rise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a matter of days, Covid forced us to reexamine how we do business, and the time to make changes is now. By focusing on the right skills, the right support, and the right technology, contact centers can navigate these unknown waters successfully, creating a new and better customer service model.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><b>Contact Center Automation is transforming the way customer service gets done \u2013 from agent productivity to customer satisfaction.
