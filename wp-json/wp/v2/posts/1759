Cybersecurity threats. Supply chain disruptions. Service outages. Modern-day forces have never been more prevalent and unpredictable. For contact centers, this creates massive customer service challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s not to mention the biggest driver of call spikes over the last two years: the pandemic. According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the pandemic has created 68% more call escalations, 50% more difficult calls and 34% longer hold times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From ecommerce to insurance to finance, every contact center in every industry has felt the strain. Contact centers simply can\u2019t scale up and down fast enough to meet customer demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, forecasting immediate and future staffing needs has become unreliable at best. Contact centers must take a good hard look at the consequences of rising call volumes in their business in order to understand the potential solutions.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Agents get overwhelmed\u00a0<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excess stress on agents impairs their ability to provide good service, while on the other hand, the pandemic has increased both customer demand and expectations. These conditions have fueled the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-the-great-resignation-is-impacting-contact-centers-in-10-data-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great Resignation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in contact centers, and made it harder than ever to retain talent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do about it: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation acts as a first line of defense for tier-1 requests. Less time is spent on monotonous requests, and more time on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/why-contact-center-agents-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-replicant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enriching customer conversations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that require creativity, empathy, and human connection.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Scheduling becomes a guessing game<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has become unfeasible to try and forecast staffing needs, let alone find enough agents to address sudden spikes in call volumes. For the customer, this means they can\u2019t expect consistent wait times or predict how much time they\u2019ll need to make a call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do about it: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike seasonal hiring or BPOs, contact center automation provides\u00a0 unlimited scale to contact centers at a fraction of the cost. Automation is like having an infinite supply of your best tier-1 agents, and is available 24\/7, 365.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/your-checklist-to-survive-the-contact-center-labor-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7425\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/ChecklistToSurviveCCLaborCrisis_2501x469-2-1024x192.png\" alt=\"Overcome the contact center labor crisis with Replicant.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Customers grow more frustrated<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsurprisingly, when contact centers get overwhelmed customer satisfaction plummets. Strategies like self-service, deflection-oriented IVRs, and chatbots usually end up frustrating customers who just want to speak to an agent or ask a simple question.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do about it: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By automating more calls, agents are freed up to spend more time with customers who need it while automation quickly resolves simple requests. For the customer, this means they no longer have to wait on hold to start resolving any issue.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Data gets lost<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contact centers are burdened with staffing challenges and unmanageable spikes in call volumes, data analysis suffers. Customers who are turned away by IVRs or long wait times become unaccounted for, and low CSAT calls get missed by managers focused on simply getting their phones answered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do about it: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without an effective analytics solution, calls during high-volume periods can get locked in black boxes of data. Automation can take care of after-call work like transcribing and tagging, and make data-driven recommendations via a simple dashboard.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Automation gets kicked down the road<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another consequence contact centers experience on a macro level is the opportunity cost of remaining stagnant. The status quo of workforce management means managers must stay focused on increasing agent productivity, instead of transforming agents entirely by eliminating routine calls from their workloads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do about it: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation can start small and scale as your organization needs it to. By automating even the most simple flows like customer authentication and account updates, contact centers begin the process of building customer data that can scale to further automation use cases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/the-great-resignation-why-your-contact-center-wont-survive-without-automation-2\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7070\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheGreatResignation_2501x469-1-1024x192.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contact Centers Can&#8217;t Keep Up With Skyrocketing Call Volumes Catastrophic weather events.
