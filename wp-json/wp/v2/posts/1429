It\u2019s true that machines are taking over some human jobs, but there will always be a place for both humans and machines in this world.<br \/>\nAs we try to envision what that world will exactly look like, someone who can offer us a glimpse into the future is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/catie-cuan-11605513\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Catie Cuan<\/a>. Cuan is a dancer, choreographer, researcher, and mechanical engineering PhD candidate at Stanford University, who blends her artistic work with robotics. For Cuan, three things stand out to her as she looks toward the future.<\/p>\n<h2>Shared autonomy between humans and machines<\/h2>\n<p>Human-in-the-loop is the idea of human-assisted machine interactions. When humans have shared or partial autonomy of a machine, they can help solve issues that machines run into. This is extremely useful because it\u2019s difficult to account for every single scenario a robot might encounter when you take it out of a controlled environment and place it into the real world. \u201cThere\u2019s this enormous long tail of what can actually happen in the real world,\u201d explains Cuan.<\/p>\n<p>Cuan offers the example of a delivery robot. Even if the robot has a perfect map of where to go and it\u2019s a perfectly sunny day, the robot may run into unforeseen obstacles that it doesn\u2019t know how to handle. There may be something blocking the ramp that the robot needs to drive up. This would be the perfect time to call a human operator or teleoperator and give them control of the robot in order to solve the issue.<\/p>\n<h2>Machines will take many forms<\/h2>\n<p>Cuan believes we\u2019re headed in the direction of creating machines that are physically soft and malleable. The robot might be made out of soft material, like cloth or plastic. It wouldn\u2019t matter whether the robot ends up in a situation that wasn\u2019t anticipated, since it isn\u2019t able to hurt anyone.<\/p>\n<h2>Infrastructure made for robots<\/h2>\n<p>Lastly, Cuan sees the rise of infrastructure that\u2019s built for robots. For example, autonomous vehicles could be successful today if we blocked off a part of the road for them that humans couldn\u2019t move through. This provides a more controlled environment for the vehicles to operate in. By adapting infrastructure, we can make autonomous machines less dangerous when they\u2019re operating out in the real world.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the future of human and machine interactions will mostly lie in between giving machines 100% autonomy and none. \u201cAnyone who is betting on full autonomy is doing so with the narrowest of possible scopes and tasks.\u201d Think of the Roomba, an autonomous vacuum cleaner. It does one task \u2014 vacuuming. And it\u2019s constrained to one environment \u2014 a room or house.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a lot of other things in the middle that turn this spectrum from two dimensions into infinitely many,\u201d says Cuan. With infinite opportunities in the middle of the two extremes, this is where companies can get the most out of their AI and automation efforts right now. <a
