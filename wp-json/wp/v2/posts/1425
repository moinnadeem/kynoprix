COVID-19 has also introduced new consumer expectations \u2014 most notably, the demand for touchless contact.<\/p>\n<p>Although most people haven\u2019t been traveling in the last year, this will likely change as more of the population gets vaccinated. Hospitality companies need to be prepared to capture and retain this business when it happens. Hotels can achieve this by using voice AI to provide contact-free hospitality while delivering a top-notch customer experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Offer Smart Hotel Rooms That Drive Customer Satisfaction<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/973815\/worldwide-digital-voice-assistant-in-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statista<\/a>, 4.2 billion digital voice assistants were used worldwide in 2020. The number of digital voice assistants is forecasted to increase to 8.4 billion by 2024 \u2014 a number exceeding the global population. With increasing use of digital voice assistants as the main point of interaction with smartphones and home devices, consumers are now demanding similar experiences in their everyday lives, like when they stay at a hotel.<\/p>\n<p>With a \u201csmart hotel room,\u201d guests can control much of their experience through AI-enabled voice devices. Smart hotel rooms combine \u201cAI and voice recognition technology to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2020\/02\/20\/10-examples-of-customer-experience-innovation-in-hospitality\/?sh=7c135e342033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrate virtual assistants<\/a> into [the guest experience].\u201d With this transformational technology, guests can use voice control to get personalized assistance, such as requesting the thermostat be turned down or asking for directions to the on-site gym. Guests can speak naturally in their native language because AI understands different languages, accents, dialects, and slang, which results in a more seamless guest experience.<\/p>\n<p>Due to COVID-19, more consumers prefer touchless interaction. \u201cIn fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capgemini.com\/research\/covid-19-and-the-age-of-the-contactless-customer-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">62% of consumers<\/a> expect to increase their use of touchless technologies once this crisis subsides.\u201d Smart hotel rooms not only reduce contact, but also make it easier for guests to settle right in and have a comfortable stay.<\/p>\n<p>According to Oracle\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/webfolder\/s\/delivery_production\/docs\/FY16h1\/doc31\/Hotels-2025-v5a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hotel 2025 study<\/a>, a typical hotel guest spends 12 to 15 minutes trying to figure out how to operate the thermostat, TV, lights, and other controls in the room. A voice-activated solution can quickly solve this frustration for guests. According to the same study, \u201c78% of hotel operators said voice-activated controls for lights, air conditioning, and room devices would be mainstream or in mass adoption by 2025.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And what do guests say? According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/webfolder\/s\/delivery_production\/docs\/FY16h1\/doc31\/Hotels-2025-v5a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oracle\u2019s study<\/a>, \u201c59% of consumers said that voice-activated controls for lights, air conditioning, and room devices would enhance the guest experience, [while] 36% would stay more often if offered this service.\u201d With hotel rooms evolving into a more personalized experience for travelers, voice AI helps hospitality companies personalize and improve the consumer\u2019s experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide AI Concierge Services to Scale Customer Service<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to smart rooms, hotels can offer AI voice-enabled concierge services. Guests can interact with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/chatbots-vs-voice-ai-customer-service-tools-that-are-disrupting-the-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">virtual agents<\/a> to book an appointment at the spa or get a restaurant recommendation, for example. When AI handles the mundane, repetitive requests, front desk personnel can better handle more complex needs or focus their time on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hospitalitynet.org\/opinion\/4097986.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creating personal relationships with hotel guests<\/a>. Additionally, voice-enabled agents can respond quicker and ensure more accurate responses, reducing the cost of human error.<\/p>\n<p>As the world recovers from COVID-19, there\u2019s pent-up consumer demand for travel. However, hotels are facing a difficult situation. They don\u2019t know when and to what extent the demand for travel will return, and they need to meet that demand with reduced staff and budgets. Being able to efficiently and quickly scale customer service is more important than ever. Using voice AI, hotels can serve more customers with the same amount of resources and scale customer service up or down as demand fluctuates. AI can respond to any number of calls, ensuring every customer is immediately helped and doesn\u2019t experience a wait time.<\/p>\n<p>The new customer service model for hospitality is not a thing of the future. It\u2019s here now. By incorporating voice AI into your customer service strategy, hotels can enhance the customer experience while driving efficiency to keep guests coming back for more.<\/p>\n<div
