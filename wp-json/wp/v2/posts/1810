Think of the clunky menus with Interactive Voice Response (IVRs) and you\u2019ll know what we mean.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this gap, we focused on perfecting our AI platform to offer the most natural human-to-machine conversations ever crafted. In the last few years alone, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine has automated over 30 million calls for some of the world\u2019s largest and most beloved brands. Along the way, we\u2019ve successfully matched or exceeded the CSAT scores and average handle times achieved by human agents for those calls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, we\u2019ve always known that to create truly exceptional customer service experiences, offering the Thinking Machine on a single channel wouldn\u2019t be enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why we\u2019ve launched omnichannel capabilities that apply that same great voice experience across channels for consistency and ease of deployment \u2013 with a single, integrated conversation engine that powers all channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the same conversation engine that finally cracked the code on voice powers a unified Contact Center Automation platform\u00a0 \u2013 one that can resolve issues across voice, messaging, and other digital channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, customers get a consistent experience, with seamless channel switching, across every touchpoint. Contact center leaders get visibility into cross-channel transcripts, in one dashboard. And agents get seamless handoffs for sensitive issues, without losing context.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unifying Customer and Agent Experiences\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer experience benefits of \u201cmeeting customers where they are\u201d by operating on multiple channels is, at this point, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2022\/04\/22\/conversational-ai-tools-should-unify-calling-messaging-analytics-and-more\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">well-studied<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; the most appropriate channel will vary depending on what the customer is doing, the action they\u2019re taking, or simply their personal preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center leaders know this, but to-date it\u2019s been surprisingly difficult to execute on. We consistently hear from our customers and prospects that they leverage different partners and platforms to automate different pieces of the customer journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This disparate approach leads to frustrating customer experiences, tool fragmentation for agents, and high operational overhead for the call center and IT teams who tie it all together. It can also scatter valuable data, and lock conversational insights in a black box.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why do they do this? Simply put, contact center leaders have been unable to find a partner who can meet all of their needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Contact Center Automation, contact center leaders can leverage a single conversation engine to both simplify and supercharge their automation journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Shared Machine Learning Brain <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s proprietary AI engine understands the unique nuances of written and verbal communication to support natural communication for each channel. A shared intent library makes it easy to scale learnings across channels without repeating efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Consistent Cross-channel Customer Experience <\/b>We\u2019ve all had the experience of repeating ourselves multiple times as we\u2019re passed between parties and departments. Replicant integrates deeply into your contact center ecosystem to know where the customer has been, and what they\u2019ve done, improving customer experiences and reducing average handle times.<\/p>\n<p><b>Omnichannel Visibility with a Single Dashboard <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant eliminates the need to pull conversation data from multiple sources by unifying conversation transcripts for every customer interaction, across all channels, in a single dashboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Seamless Live Agent Handoff <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant integrates seamlessly with live agent platforms to handoff complex issues that require human empathy without losing customer context. It gives agents the ability to quickly understand the request, while making sure customers who need a live agent can get to one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation platform gives leaders a comprehensive option for omnichannel service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It provides relief in a time where companies simply cannot hire or retain enough agents, and it protects against rising unpredictable spikes in customer demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the whole, it simplifies a complex web of standalone automation solutions that have frustrated customers, agents, and industry leaders for years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers can free up their agents to focus on more complex and engaging requests, and offer customers an unparalleled automation experience.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Read the full press release or download the guide for more information on our omnichannel features.\u00a0<\/b><a
