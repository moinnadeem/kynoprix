The firm\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/aragonresearch.com\/aragon-research-hot-vendors-for-2022-part-2\/\">report<\/a> identified vendors who offer technology solutions within the enterprise that ultimately improve the customer experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis recognition from Aragon Research validates that businesses are embracing Contact Center Automation and certifies our efforts to create scalable customer support that doesn\u2019t compromise the customer experience,\u201d said Gadi Shamia, co-founder and CEO of Replicant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur vision is to create an automation experience that is helpful, fast and pleasant to use that enterprises will want to continue to adopt, so we can change the state of customer service worldwide.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the leader in Contact Center Automation, this recognition is important to us for a few reasons:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>1. Contact Centers Are in Crisis<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last year, we\u2019ve heard story after story of contact centers struggling to hire enough agents, plan for unpredictable spikes in call volumes, and navigate economic uncertainty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These challenges have led to a customer service crisis that has put brands at risk and greatly reduced the level of service customers receive. We\u2019ve made it a part of our mission to double down on Contact Center Automation <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to help companies automate their most common customer service calls while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers are able to automate common customer requests 24\/7 at\u00a0 unlimited scale. On average, customers go-live with Replicant in 8 to 12 weeks, see a decrease in cost per contact of 50%, and improve average handle time (AHT) and customer satisfaction (CSAT).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>2. Human-to-Machine Conversations Power Everything We Do<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accomplish true Contact Center Automation, we developed the first \u201cThinking Machine,\u201d a conversation engine capable of having complex, multi-intent conversations with humans to resolve common customer service issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is through this technology that contact centers can offer seamless, automated experiences in any language, while gaining access to rich insights into every customer interaction via auto-generated and fully transcribed conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The engineers and conversation designers behind Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine ensure that every conversation is the most effective and natural human-to-machine interaction a customer will ever experience. Meanwhile, continuous learning ensures that conversations with the Thinking Machine are always improving:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat makes Replicant hot is its ability to continuously learn from its conversations and other knowledge sources to autonomously improve future conversations without the need to retrain or redeploy manually,\u201d said Jim Lundy, CEO and lead analyst of Aragon Research. &#8220;The Thinking Machine also leverages a shared intent library so deploying new automated conversation flows across channels or languages is fast and consistent with Replicant.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b><\/b>3. We Care About Our Customers\u2019 Customers<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our inclusion in the Hot Vendors category wouldn\u2019t be possible without the deep partnerships we have with our customers. Replicant\u2019s technology isn\u2019t designed to simply deflect callers or route them more efficiently, but instead to completely transform the customer and agent experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/50-leaders-transforming-contact-centers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact center innovators<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from some of the world\u2019s most reputable brands, Replicant has been able to apply the Thinking Machine to diverse\u00a0 customer bases across industries \u2013 from Travel &amp; Hospitality, to Insurance, to Retail &amp; eCommerce, and many more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These partnerships have proven that a customer-first approach to Contact Center Automation can return exceptionally high CSAT scores with personalized interactions and branded experiences built for the modern age. They have also shown the ability to transform the agent experience by completely <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/myth-automation-is-bad-for-customer-service-agents-heres-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offloading\u00a0 tier 1 requests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that typically fatigue agents and lead to greater employee attrition.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>4. We\u2019re Just Getting Started<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aragon\u2019s \u201cHot Vendor\u201d report highlights a few of the capabilities that define Replicant\u2019s technology:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Completely automate the resolution of common customer service calls<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide a rich library of pre-built conversation components to streamline the design and deployment of conversation flows\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide real-time visibility into conversations with rich analytics to uncover key trends and enhance the customer experience with self-service script editing<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond our core features, Replicant\u2019s vision for Contact Center Automation continues to evolve. Just this year, we launched omnichannel support, giving contact center leaders the ability to deploy automation across channels faster with a single conversation engine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
