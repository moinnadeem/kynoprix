And despite the rise of digital channels like chat and SMS, they can still include long wait times when trying to speak to a live agent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many innovative contact centers have already taken action by implementing Contact Center Automation. Contact Center Automation leverages conversational AI to offload high-volume, tier-1 requests from their live agents and free them to connect with customers who need high-touch service. These contact centers are seeing reduced or no wait times as a result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the majority of contact centers are still using ineffective IVRs, costly BPOs, or chatbots that can\u2019t truly automate tier-1 customer requests and come with their own customer frustration points. In other words, 43 days will continue to be the lifetime sacrifice for many customers stuck waiting to get their issues resolved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put that into perspective, here are seven things you could accomplish in that time:<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 1920px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1774-1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/Replicant-7-Things-v5.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/Replicant-7-Things-v5.mp4\">https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/Replicant-7-Things-v5.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>1.
