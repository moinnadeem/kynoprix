Almost half cite \u2018too many calls\u2019 as their biggest challenge. They\u2019re being asked to manage 7.2 more calls per day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a big part of why Contact Center Automation has seen a rapid rise in adoption among customer service departments in the past few years. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation uses state-of-the-art conversational AI to completely automate tier 1 support conversations across every channel, with more efficacy than any solution before.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps contact centers \u2013 who have been rocked by global labor shortages \u2013 provide stellar, no-wait service no matter how many requests they get, or agents they have on hand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it can also help agents be better, and more engaged, at their jobs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation provides unprecedented analytics that can help managers innovate quickly, improve efficiencies, and most importantly improve their existing agents. Here\u2019s how:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Capture Accurate CSAT Reporting For Common Use Cases<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation collects a higher volume, and more accurate measurements, of customer satisfaction for every conversation. This means agents get a better view into what customers respond well to and what they don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, a single dashboard tracks customer satisfaction alongside full transcripts of every conversation over every channel. Agents can use the auto-tagged data to dig into turn-by-turn analysis of conversations and gain a greater understanding of why customers call. Trends in conversation results and CSAT for each conversation flow help to understand the best paths for positive outcomes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Gain Rich Context for Escalated Conversations<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation focuses on achieving resolutions, not vanity metrics like containment which doesn\u2019t tell managers whether customers actually got to where they needed to go. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/thinking-machine\/\">Thinking Machine<\/a> can detect when customers are frustrated, or when it\u2019s faced with a request it\u2019s not intended to resolve.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these cases, the Thinking Machine focuses on getting customers where they need to go as efficiently as possible. We make sure that live agents who pick up a conversation are equipped with every piece of information, data, and context they need via an automated screen pop so that customers get the most seamless experience possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Surface Dispositions for Every Escalation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact center leaders can automatically capture dispositions based on what customers are saying to understand the breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative conversation outcomes and identify areas for improvement by drilling into negative dispositions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thinking Machine has automated millions of calls and chats, but they don\u2019t always include requests that are able to take the \u201chappy path.\u201d Replicant surfaces sentiment analysis and for every turn and accurately auto-tags the transcripts it creates. From a single dashboard, agents can see what led to an escalation or what may have led to a zero-out. With this real-time data, agents don\u2019t go into calls blind and don\u2019t need to repeat questions a customer may have already answered.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Create Effortless <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-perfect-storm-why-contact-centers-are-in-crisis-and-how-theyll-recover\/\">Automation Roadmapping<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengthened contact center data doesn\u2019t just help agents today, it allows contact centers to surface new ways to help them in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Replicant\u2019s dashboard, support flows that are ripe for automation get surfaced automatically. If your contact center is experiencing heightened volumes for a particular tier 1 issue, or finding that escalations are occurring for an issue that can be automated, you\u2019ll know about it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation can start small with just one use case and scale periodically. Automating even simple requests like customer authentication and account updates will unveil new ways to offload repetitive tasks from stretched-thin agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Maximize Live Agents&#8217; Time<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation doesn\u2019t aim to displace human agents. Rather, it takes a hybrid approach to team up with agents and divide and conquer support requests, while also automating back-office and after-call work. The Thinking Machine excels at taking care of repetitive and mundane work and letting human agents respond to calls that require more empathy and creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the agent, this means more of their time can be spent on high-value customer interactions that allow them to establish relationships with creativity and empathy. It also frees up time for upskilling, certifications, and professional development that can help them earn higher wages and find new ways to leverage automation data to improve efficiencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Center Automation is transforming the way customer service gets done \u2013 from agent productivity to customer satisfaction.
