As a result, they attempt to spend as little as possible by hiring too few agents, outsourcing overflow calls, and purchasing older automation solutions that don\u2019t work well. What they typically don\u2019t realize is that, with the right solution, their customer service operations could actually increase ROI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This solution is called call center automation. It integrates with a variety of other customer service solutions so that any customer service department can implement automation without compromising frictionless customer experience, even temporarily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why Insufficient Call Capacity Affects Customer Experience<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly everyone who has tried to call customer service has had the experience of being placed on hold for half an hour or more. This is due to a common problem in the world of customer experience; call centers are understaffed and can\u2019t handle their call volumes. The result is long hold times, inefficient processes, poor analytics, and little possibility of improvement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2019\/12\/16\/100-stats-on-digital-transformation-and-customer-experience\/?sh=966bc663bf3e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that over three-fourths of consumers expect companies to understand their needs and expectations. As a result, insufficient call capacity and the hold times that come with it can be a decisive turnoff for a potential customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Can Call Center Automation Increase Call Capacity?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most obvious solution to streamline customer service is to hire more agents. However, that would require more equipment, more employees, and a higher budget, making it an impractical option for many companies. But this doesn\u2019t mean companies should give up on effective call center capacity planning. Instead of trying to stumble along with understaffed call centers and overworked agents, they can implement Replicant\u2019s call center automation solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, automation has a rather poor reputation among customers who have called the customer service line only to be put on hold for hours and never have their issue resolved. While this is often the case with older solutions, new call center automation technology allows more natural conversations with customers and escalates certain requests to the appropriate live agent. Today, machine learning is able to improve efficiency over time, offering the ability for full contact center optimization. Learn which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/call-center-automation-what-chats-and-calls-should-you-automate\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chats and calls you should automate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Automation Works Alongside Live Agents<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant doesn\u2019t aim to replace live agents. Rather, it\u2019s intended to work alongside live agents to handle repetitive and mundane customer requests through contact center optimization. Depending on a business\u2019s current customer service situation, automation makes it possible for agents to answer more interactive requests while minimizing or eliminating customer wait times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer service centers get hundreds of calls every day from customers who simply want to edit their account information, reset a password, or cancel a credit card. From the customers\u2019 perspective, an automation system immediately resolves their issue \u2013 and they won\u2019t need to wait even five or ten minutes for a live agent to become available. From the agent&#8217;s perspective, they\u2019re not spending hours every day talking to irritated customers who have been holding for a half-hour. They\u2019re also not spending their time inputting the same information, answering the same questions, and watching the backlog of calls pile up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Automation in Customer Service<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2022\/09\/20\/brainstorm-tech-genpact-artificial-intelligence-lessons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortune<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes that for technology to be successful in the customer service world, there must be a \u201cclear and measurable impact to bottom lines.\u201d Contact center optimization through automation has far-reaching benefits that impact the day-to-day of customers and agents in a call center.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because contact center optimization doesn\u2019t depend on agents to function, it can help protect against unpredictable spikes in call volume. As a result, call center automation is particularly effective for companies that are growing, experiencing seasonal surges, or modifying processes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially with current labor shortages, jobs need to be appealing to hire and retain skilled agents. Answering calls might not seem attractive to a potential employee, but the job can become far more interesting and interactive with call center automation solutions handling all Tier One calls. Agents don\u2019t need to spend their workday resolving tedious questions. Instead, they\u2019ll answer more meaningful customer requests and actually make a difference in how customers view the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re ready to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/request-a-demo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase call capacity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, reduce hold times, and improve customer service, request a custom demonstration.
