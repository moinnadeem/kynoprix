However, others were able to maintain their growth, and even accelerate their plans, through proactive customer-focused strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Harvard Business Review <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/what-companies-should-do-to-prepare-for-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> analyzing companies with exceptionally high returns in 2009, resilient organizations were found to have done two things. First: they cut costs earlier than others; by the first quarter of 2008, resilient companies had already cut operating costs by 1% compared to the prior year, even as costs grew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second: resilient companies focused on maintaining loyalty among high-value customers who proved to be central to the company\u2019s long-term growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When planning for a recession, here are 5 priorities that drive sustainable growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key focus areas to protect against a recession\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Customer experience is your biggest differentiator<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just how much do customers value exceptional experiences? According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/customer-service-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, customers base 70% of their buying experience simply on how they feel they are being treated. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">62% of customers say they share their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/customer-service-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bad experiences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with others, while 72% of customers will share their good experiences with others. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a bearish market where consumers are expected to be more selective in how they spend, the value of great CX is exponential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Loyalty is a lifeboat\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great customer experiences don\u2019t just increase the likelihood that a company will recover from a recession, they also help secure recurring revenue throughout. According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/survey-the-effects-of-bad-customer-service-and-how-brands-can-fix-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant 2021 Customer Service Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 76% of consumers say a poor customer service experience negatively impacts their perception of a brand and one in three say it affects loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase profits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 25% to 95%; loyalty leaders <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/01\/are-you-undervaluing-your-customers?ab=at_art_art_1x1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow revenues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers. If you\u2019re a contact center leader, this should come as no surprise. Customer loyalty doesn\u2019t just create more revenue. It manifests itself in invaluable customer relationships that motivate buyers to not only stay with a product or service, but become evangelists on behalf of reputable brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Data drives growth<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern customer experiences benefit brands, too. According to Katy George, a senior partner at McKinsey, the first <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/how-to-survive-a-recession-and-thrive-afterward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reason to prioritize digital transformation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ahead of a downturn is that \u201cimproved analytics can help management better understand the business, how the recession is affecting it, and where there\u2019s potential for operational improvements.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second reason is that digital technology can help cut costs. Companies should prioritize \u201cself-funding\u201d transformation projects that pay off quickly, George says, such as automating tasks or adopting data-driven decision making.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Competitors may de-prioritize transformation, but you shouldn\u2019t<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to point to the benefits of prioritizing customer experiences and innovation during economic drawbacks, but it can be much harder to get an entire organization on board. At the end of any period of prolonged economic instability, only a few companies are found to have actually implemented solutions that position them for growth. The majority of companies are instead left revisiting digital transformation projects they put on hold at the start of a downturn once it\u2019s too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/how-to-survive-a-recession-and-thrive-afterward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Bain using data from the Great Recession found that just the top 10% of companies saw their earnings climb steadily throughout the period and continue to rise afterward. The difference maker was proactive preparation. Among the companies that stagnated in the aftermath of the Great Recession, \u201cfew made contingency plans or thought through alternative scenarios,\u201d according to the Bain report, \u201cwhen the downturn hit, they switched to survival mode, making deep cuts and reacting defensively.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Automation is built for unpredictability<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the recent climate defined by hiring challenges and unpredictable customer demand, a modern customer experience must include a level of automation.
