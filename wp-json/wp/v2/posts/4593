Unlike IVRs or chatbots, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine\u2122\ufe0f brings reliability where CX leaders need it \u2013 like security, Natural Language Understanding, and real-time analytics \u2013 and flexibility where it matters: conversation design, integrations, and personal, branded experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as no two solutions are alike, businesses find value from Contact Center Automation in many different ways. Naya Mehta, Head of Customer Success at Replicant, gave an overview of value realization at Resolve 2022 and shed light on the many ROI levers of automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the below categories are certainly not the only examples of realized automation value, they\u2019re top of mind priorities for most CX leaders and represent key focus areas for the foreseeable future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workforce Management<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you optimize your agents, staff and supervisors in a complex and unpredictable environment? With Contact Center Automation, that answer can become a lot simpler:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Seasonality &amp; Spikes <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned and unplanned spikes can happen over the course of\u00a0 weeks, months, or even a single day. Replicant allows contact centers to be nimble so they never miss orders, lose revenue, or get overwhelmed by demand.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Headcount planning <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant is not in the business of eliminating agents. Instead, contact centers gain the ability to plan for a mix of in-house, outsourced, and automated agents to lower their risk and increase the speed of service across the board. With out-of-the-box analytics, managers can even gain insights to better determine how to deploy their headcount.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Talent management\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your best agents should be on your most important calls and with Replicant they can be. \u201cWe\u2019re now open 24\/7,\u201d said Mike Bowman, Senior Director, Operations, ECSI. \u201cWe used to operate on typical business day hours, and today we probably take about 30% of our overall contact traffic after normal business hours. It\u2019s really taken a lot of the volume out from the normal day and flattened that curve so that agents have a lot less work to do and take their time to work on relationship building with the callers\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Immediate &amp; consistent service <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may sound counterintuitive to say that customer satisfaction increases when customers talk to a machine. But today\u2019s customers are used to long wait times or even buried customer service numbers that aim to deflect inbound callers rather than serve them. Replicant has seen CSAT rise in every instance of automation because it\u2019s consistent and reliable.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>End-to-end resolution with self-service <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers feel comfortable when they receive simple outbound messages like \u201cyour tow truck is on the way,\u201d or \u201cyour package is out for delivery.\u201d From start to finish, Replicant helps customer support become an extension of a product or service so customers don\u2019t feel like their transaction ended the moment they paid. The Thinking Machine achieves a 90% resolution rate without escalations on average to build a foundation of trust from the start.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fast and natural experiences <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers are constantly looking for ways to be more accommodating to customer preferences. Replicant understands that if a customer is calling in, they probably don\u2019t want to be directed to an app. Conversely, if they\u2019re chatting with support in an app, they probably don\u2019t want to be told to call a number. Replicant makes it easy to keep conversations natural and frictionless so customers are never inconvenienced. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost of our callers are millennials,\u201d said Bowman. \u201cWhat really opened our eyes several years ago is we got a complaint from a college student that they didn\u2019t want to have to talk to us. It reinforced the idea that self-service and automation is a good choice for that particular demographic.\u201d Mike Bowman<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business Process Improvement<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Eliminate repetitive tasks <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mehta\u2019s presentation included an illuminating customer story. Prior to partnering with Replicant, ADP would call all mid-sized customers when they were in danger of missing payroll. As a legal requirement, this call was very important, but also very repetitive. By automating the call and integrating an RPA solution that also sent an email, they cut human work for the process by a staggering 90%.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Boost agent processes <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From more efficient agent handoffs to more time to improve the agent experience, automation adds value to agent production. \u201cWhen you have contact centers that are hitting 90-something percent occupancy and it\u2019s call after call after call, even our agents can get a bit salty or crusty,\u201d said one Resolve attendee. \u201cFrom and end customer perspective, when they do talk to an agent, if that agent is not as overwhelmingly tired because they haven&#8217;t had a chance to breathe between calls, I have to expect that the CX on those calls will be better as well.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part of what makes Contact Center Automation such an impactful solution is that it\u2019s not&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":4594,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
