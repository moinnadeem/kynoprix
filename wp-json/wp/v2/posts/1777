However, according to a survey by Businesswire, most organizations lack the prompt response customers are looking for.<\/p>\n<p>The average customer service wait time tends to be nearly 20 minutes; 62% of survey participants said they\u2019d waited longer than 10 minutes and 23% had waited for a half-hour or longer. The article goes on to say that customers\u2019 biggest fear is going back to the start. \u201cAmericans are frustrated by inefficient customer service that wastes time,\u201d it reads. When asked to name their top three customer service frustrations, 68% selected \u201cgetting disconnected and having to start over\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in charge of developing or improving your organization\u2019s customer service, you\u2019ll want to figure out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/which-type-of-contact-center-fits-your-business-best\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which type of contact center fits your business best<\/a>. But first, you\u2019ll want to understand the differences.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Difference Between Contact Centers and Call Centers?<\/h2>\n<p>Though the terms \u201ccontact center\u201d and \u201ccall center\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, they\u2019re actually not the same thing. They both handle customer interaction; however, call center solutions only communicate through phone calls while a contact center uses a variety of communication channels including messaging, texts, emails, and social media.<\/p>\n<h2>Contact Centers Key to Customer Relationships<\/h2>\n<p>According to an article in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/amazonwebservices\/2021\/09\/08\/disrupting-the-contact-center-with-machine-learning-differentiating-on-customer-experience\/?sh=2388545a20d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Forbes<\/a>, a contact center is often the first and only interaction an organization has with a customer. \u201cRather than viewing the contact center as a cost center, brands need to start viewing it as an opportunity for technology investments that drive a more intimate relationship with customers and competitive differentiation,\u201d the article continues.<\/p>\n<p>By thinking of contact centers as a direct and ready connection to prospects and customers, companies will change their perception of this important function. Businesses that invest in automation technology can transform contact centers into effective tools for building better\u00a0 customer relationships. Not only can problems and complaints be resolved more quickly, but companies can capitalize on new opportunities as well.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Contact and Call Centers<\/h2>\n<p>Both contact and call centers have advantages and disadvantages.<\/p>\n<p>Contact centers tend to be more technologically advanced than call alternatives. Because contact centers are more data-driven, they are able to generate more analytics and insights than a call center. Conversations can be transcribed so that managers can understand why customers are reaching out.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, call centers focus on simple dialogue management, essentially executing phone calls as quickly as possible. Talking on the phone is currently one of the most preferred communication methods within customer service, and it may not make financial sense for your organization to use a contact center.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Decide Between a Contact Center vs. a Call Center<\/h2>\n<p>Businesses must examine their individual situations in order to determine whether a call center or a contact center is the best solution for them.<\/p>\n<p>If call volumes are high, you may want to choose a call center. They are most effective if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Additional data and statistics won\u2019t help your team.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">You\u2019re currently unable to afford the additional technology a contact center requires.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">You\u2019d prefer to focus on automating call center processes rather than branching out into other modes of communication.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, contact centers certainly have their benefits. Consider a contact center if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Your organization is financially able to create one.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Data is necessary for improvements.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Your customers are dissatisfied with phone calls as the only method of communication.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of the communication center you choose to implement, automating processes should be a priority. Both call and contact center employees tend to have more work than they\u2019re able to handle. Automating basic requests frees the customer service team up so that they can handle more complicated problems on a timely basis.<\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation Solution<\/h2>\n<p>Replicant\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/intelligent-virtual-agent\/\">intelligent virtual agent<\/a> resolves customer service issues autonomously, improving your organization\u2019s call or contact center.
