But in order to truly improve customer experiences, holiday spikes should be learned from as much as they are planned for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonal surges represent a \u201cknown outcome\u201d for most service leaders. They come around every year, they include expected costs and challenges, and they are thought about well in advance. But they also share similarities to the kinds of unpredictable spikes that can cost even more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cService leaders must now plan for the known outcomes, such as a seasonal surge or product launches, as well as the unknown outcomes \u2014 those events completely out of leader control,\u201d says Jeffrey Schott, Director, Team Manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/are-you-prepared-for-call-center-spikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gartner<\/a>. \u201cBy planning for these unexpected times, call centers can maintain the desired standard of service.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CX leaders can use periods of expected demand to assess their readiness for unexpected spikes down the road. To start, ask your team to reflect on these questions throughout the holiday season:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your edge cases?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holiday spikes can lead to increased amounts of complex calls from frustrated customers. From weather events to travel and supply chain disruptions, these calls require agents to be both available and equipped to handle them. CX leaders should analyze this subset of requests and measure response times and resolutions, and determine how they can reserve and upskill more agents to be prepared to resolve them quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which calls are the most repetitive?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the calls that agents field, which are the most common? During the holidays, high-volume calls are often not your most complex. Auto insurance companies, for example, see an increase in standard policy questions during severe weather events. Repetitive calls that see seasonal or incident-related spikes are prime candidates to be resolved by automation so agents can focus more on customer queues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When does your IVR fail?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing exposes the weaknesses of IVR systems like a large spike in demand. They can be overloaded, receive public scrutiny, and give customers the impression they\u2019re being ignored or deflected. Measure the containment of your IVR during the holidays and explore alternative solutions that can not just withstand thousands of simultaneous requests, but resolve them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can your agents\u2019 lives be improved?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent study found that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toistersolutions.com\/burnout\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">74 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of call-center agents are at risk of burnout. This risk is heightened during the holidays \u2013 as is the probability of high turnover. CX leaders should prioritize their agents\u2019 time and input on how their lives can be made easier. What tasks take the most time? What do agents want to spend more time on? Can automation enable them to take on more engaging calls and less repetitive tasks? Starting this conversation early creates a dialogue for insights, improvement and ultimately trust when it comes to deploying AI.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where are customers reaching out?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversations best suited for an SMS or chat experience \u2013 like personal information collection and form fills \u2013 can slow agents down with longer than necessary handle times. These use cases can be easily automated through multichannel experiences that seamlessly switch from voice to text and create fast, frictionless experiences that customers love \u2013 especially when hold times are long.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonus: What costs the most?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, CX leaders must analyze the costs of their busy seasons and apply them to scenarios where large spikes come out of the blue. In most cases, the cost of unpredictable demand is much higher when it&#8217;s unplanned for. Fortunately, these instances represent the biggest opportunity to return value. CX leaders should ultimately assess their holiday season with Contact Center Automation in mind as a key lever for increasing CSAT, cutting costs, and driving efficiencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!---[CTA] Watch the on-demand session \u201cAnatomy of a Conversation\u201d from Resolve 2022 with Replicant Co-founder and CTO, Benjamin Gleitzman, and Head of Product, Meghna Suresh.---><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most contact center leaders are familiar with some of the key strategies for navigating the&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":4579,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
