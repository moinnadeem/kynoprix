(We said <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unique<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, didn\u2019t we?).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023, a strong CX strategy is more important than ever: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-automation-is-rescuing-contact-centers-from-the-great-resignation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">staffing shortages<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aren\u2019t going anywhere, call volumes are more unpredictable than before, and customer expectations are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/10-trends-contact-center-leaders-should-watch-in-2022\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the rise<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center leaders are under immense pressure to think outside the box and transform how their customers get support. Not just today, but for every Valentine\u2019s season to come.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are six reasons you should start by taking a good look at your relationship with your IVR system \u2013 and why it might be time for a breakup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Communication is key<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in any relationship, communication is key during a machine-to-human interaction. Unfortunately, most IVRs struggle with listening. 56% of consumers cite automated telephone systems as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/customerthink.com\/how-to-exceed-customer-expectations-with-omnichannel-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the most frustrating aspect<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of poor customer service. That\u2019s because IVRs usually lead to customers feeling misunderstood, requests needing to be repeated, and keywords being missed due to accents, background noise, or unique speech patterns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine can both replace your IVR, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> completely resolve customer requests with the most natural human-to-machine conversations ever created. It features a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/products\/replicant-voice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less-than-1 second latency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between conversation turns and uses advanced AI models to accurately understand customer intents over 94% of the time, without relying on keywords.<\/span><i><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>2. It\u2019s complicated<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A healthy customer-to-brand relationship should feel simple and effortless. But IVRs almost always lead to unnecessary complexity. The most common misstep customers experience are IVRs with far too many menu options, which leave them lost by the fifth item. This can lead callers to spam the \u2018zero\u2019 button to reach an agent for an issue that likely could have been automated from the start. A better option is Contact Center Automation which allows customers to simply respond to \u201chow can I help you?\u201d in their own words.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine boasts multi-intent recognition, that doesn\u2019t restrict customers to asking just one question at a time in one specific way. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/products\/power\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant Powers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> give contact centers out-of-the-box components to scale conversations fast. This includes access to an extensive library of pre-built conversation components that already incorporate conversational design best practices and cover a variety of use-cases, so conversations are simple, straightforward, and effective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Relationships are a two-way street<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRs aim to assist agents by cutting down on the number of transfers that need to take place in a given interaction. They also attempt to route customers to self-service options, preventing an agent from ever having to step in. But they aren\u2019t intended to truly serve the customer within the interaction itself. This is the number one reason customers have an overall negative perception of IVRs, viewing them as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/electronics.howstuffworks.com\/interactive-voice-response.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">waste of time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rather than a helpful tool.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant knows that, above all, benefiting the customer benefits the brand. That\u2019s why our contact center automation solution was crafted to completely resolve tier-1 customer requests. When automation isn&#8217;t suitable for a request, customers are intelligently transferred to an agent with a full summary of the request and all the necessary information to make the agent\u2019s job easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Personal time is important<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology in the contact center should hinge on one truth: connect customers to answers. IVRs too often serve as barriers to connection rather than bridges. And when agents spend the majority of their days addressing simple, monotonous calls, they\u2019re prevented from conversations that require creativity and empathy. They also have less time to improve their own skills, take a break, or address their other responsibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By automating all tier-1 calls, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine is an agent\u2019s best friend. It\u2019s infinitely scalable, and available 24\/7, which means agents can forget about the monotonous conversations and focus on connecting with customers in need, creatively solving problems, and upskilling their certifications.\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>5. Abandonment is too common<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CallCentreHelper found that up to 81% of customers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.callcentrehelper.com\/ivr-negatively-affect-customer-experience-149778.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">abandoned a call<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to an IVR. Moreover, IVR metrics usually oversimplify conversations into the categories of containment, abandonment, or escalation. Today\u2019s contact centers must strive to get more out of their systems. A frustrated customer who hangs up before getting their issue resolved can lead to massive losses for your brand, and the data behind why calls are abandoned must be accessible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With Replicant, contact center leaders get visibility into all customer support conversations through an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/conversational-ai-is-no-longer-a-black-box\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">end-to-end dashboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Contact center managers can monitor conversations, analyze insights from conversation data, and take action immediately by updating conversation scripts to create an optimal customer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cultures all over the world celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day in their own unique ways.
