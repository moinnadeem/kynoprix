Customers are willing to wait just a few minutes or not at all. Nearly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.arise.com\/resources\/blog\/arise-customer-service-frustration-series-phone-hold-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two-thirds of surveyed consumers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said they\u2019re willing to wait two minutes or less before they hang up. Over 13% said no hold time is acceptable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation enables contact centers to meet customer demand 100% of the time, without compromising on the quality of customers\u2019 experience. It provides contact centers a 1:1 agent-to-customer ratio at all times, so customers never have to wait on hold. Their call or chat is immediately picked up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant leverages proprietary transcription, inference classification, and named entity recognition models as well as a high-performance Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine with built-in continuous learning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result: a 96% peak inference accuracy, rich context from unstructured inputs, and a 20-millisecond response time. Replicant delivers conversations that regularly return higher CSAT scores than live agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spikes in call volume are flattened<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repetitive requests are usually the types of requests you\u2019ll receive an outsized volume of when experiencing a spike. Airlines are a perfect example of this. When flights are canceled due to weather, airlines experience an influx of customers asking to rebook their flight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a scalable capacity flattens these spikes, since Contact Center Automation acts as the first line of defense in taking all incoming requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some requests may require a live agent, automation drastically reduces the amount of requests that human agents need to take.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps prevent agents from being overwhelmed. With a 90% success rate in resolutions, and 50% reduction in average handle time, Replciant is able to minimize escalations, while making handoffs that do take place faster and more efficient than ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase your speed and flexibility of ramping capacity up or down<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll rarely ever get a heads up that allows you to plan and adjust your capacity. When contact centers are reacting to fluctuations in days or weeks, it can negatively impact customers\u2019 perception of your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Contact Center Automation, your capacity adjusts in minutes because you\u2019re no longer increasing or decreasing the number of human agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation can quickly ramp up in response to higher call volumes and scale back down just as quickly when volume goes down, keeping costs predictable and controllable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This speed and flexibility enables companies to grow their customer service faster. Since agents are only handling a fraction of all request volume, you can rapidly acquire new customers and ensure they\u2019re supported no matter what challenges arise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost becomes predictable<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting and scheduling requires contact centers to commit to a certain amount of agent capacity and pay for that amount. This is a fixed-cost model that locks you into paying for whatever you\u2019ve anticipated. If you\u2019ve underestimated, you\u2019ll also need to ask for more budget, which you may not get.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contact centers can instantly scale their capacity with demand, costs become predictable too. You\u2019ll only pay for the capacity you use, which is the amount of time the Thinking Machine is on the phone with customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant makes it easy to design and test flows with low-code, drag-and-drop conversation components called Replicant Powers that come pre-built with design best practices. Comprehensive integrations work out-of-the-box with any CRM, CCaaS, and telephony stack.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, enterprise grade scale provides a secure, high availability infrastructure that runs 24\/7 with 99.95% uptime commitment, redundancy, and HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI, and GDPR certifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this means that your ROI can begin compounding as soon as you deploy \u2013 in weeks, not months or years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers that adopt Contact Center Automation have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/optimize-call-center-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lower costs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Aside from only paying for the capacity you use, you don\u2019t pay for wait times and calls are 50% shorter. Scaling with automation is a lot cheaper than scaling with humans. Even compared to a highly optimized BPO, automation is about 55% cheaper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having no wait times, the perfect amount of customer capacity at all times, and reducing customer service costs by half no longer needs to be a dream. Contact Center Automation enables you to achieve these results today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Learn more about Contact Center Automation with our definitive guide.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-contact-center-automation\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7716\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheDefinitiveGuideCCAutomation_2501x469-1024x192.png\" alt=\"Learn how Contact Center Automation is transforming customer service with Replicant.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Protect Your Contact Center From Rising Unpredictability Using Automation Scaling contact centers with human resources&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":1467,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
