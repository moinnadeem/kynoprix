Pest control. Landscaping. Moving services. Heating and HVAC.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Consumer Services that make our lives easier every day are always in demand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For businesses, that\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for their contact centers, rising demand has become a major challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant enables Consumer Services companies to automate their most common customer requests so they can implement more efficient staffing strategies and resolve more calls with zero wait times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With millions of conversations automated for Consumer Services brands, our customers consistently see one major outcome: Agents are freed to focus on urgent and revenue generating engagements, which increases conversion rates and bolsters customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an industry where competition is high and customers can quickly jump to new providers, the differentiator of a better experience makes customers\u2019 lives even easier and strengthens bottom lines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which service areas are embracing automation?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Services is a broad category. But almost every vertical shares one or more of these common CX obstacles:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Seasonality &amp; Call Spikes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Call spikes are inherent to the Consumer Services industry. The warmer months spell demand for services like pest control, cleaning, landscaping and moving. Conversely, many services experience valleys in their demand which bring their own set of workforce challenges.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Agent Staffing &amp; BPO Challenges: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s never been harder to attract and retain agents in a competitive field with a shrinking labor pool. This has made staffing for seasonal peaks more expensive, and even impacted the cost of after-hours BPO agreements.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Challenging Marketing Programs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consumer Services brands often must offer incentives like free estimates to compete. But these programs fail when the demand they create can\u2019t be converted due to long wait times that frustrate prospective customers.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Call Routing Issues with Current IVRs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Outdated IVRs force customers to navigate dialpad menus and result in a high number of misrouted calls \u2013 and agents wasting time on requests that weren\u2019t meant for them (not to mention the poor CX they create).<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Lack of Visibility &amp; Prioritization: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black boxes of data create blind spots where businesses don\u2019t know the main reasons their customers are calling. This can result in an urgent call for a problem like a bursted pipe or flooded basement waiting on hold in the same queue as a customer simply looking to update their card on file.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Lack of Consumer Loyalty<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A single poor customer experience can be enough to lose their business and damage your brand reputation. Consumer Services leaders are all well aware of the long list of competitors in their area; driving customer loyalty is crucial.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these challenges boil down to a single issue: Businesses lose money when they aren&#8217;t attending to their prospective customers, existing customers or urgent customers fast enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nature of the call center in all of the below Consumer Services means agents must focus on converting new business and can\u2019t afford to spend time on tasks that don\u2019t help the bottom line:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Home Services<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Pest Control, Landscaping, Cleaning, Security, Utilities<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Home Improvement<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Repairs, Construction, Plumbing, Heating &amp; HVAC<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Moving &amp; Storage<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Junk Removal, Moving Truck Rentals &amp; Storage Rentals<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Auto Services<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Auto Repairs, Collision, Auto Spas\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/827391627?h=b5c2448d22&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"Replicant for Consumer Services\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most impactful use cases for automation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agent burnout, emotional exhaustion and high levels of turnover are not new challenges for contact centers. In 2021, the contact center <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.callcentrehelper.com\/images\/resources\/2022\/nice-attrition-to-retention-global-survey-20220211.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attrition rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the U.S. was 42%, and climbed to 50% for contact centers with over 5,000 agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When mundane, repetitive tasks are automated, contact centers nip the problem in the bud.

After over a year of evaluating automation solutions, they partnered with Replicant for two reasons: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Thinking Machine is so much more lifelike than anything we\u2019ve seen before, which is huge with highly emotional customers,\u201d they said. \u201cThe second reason was how attentive and helpful Replicant was.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Challenge<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of their marketing strategy includes free termite inspections to capture new business. But due to the seasonal nature of the business, prospective customers would call in to redeem the offer at the same time and agents couldn&#8217;t handle all the volume. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prospective customers were waiting on hold for 20+ minutes and eventually hung up, leading to poor conversion rates and high abandonment rates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Partnership<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant was deployed to automate call routing, authentication, account management, and appointment scheduling. Within weeks, customers were getting accurately routed to the right agent on first attempt, urgent requests were escalated quickly, and new customers could schedule inspections with zero wait times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, the contact center now had visibility into why customers were calling, providing new opportunities to prioritize request types and deploy agents more efficiently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Outcome<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Services customers that use Replicant have all experienced dramatic increases in their call resolution rates. With dozens of repeatable use cases and millions of calls automated, our experience includes learnings for achieving high resolution rates on day one. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, this customer saw an accelerated time to value resulting from our ability to establish the API calls, fields, and resources needed to get up and running quickly. Compared to the months to years-long projects most automation deployments entail, the ability to start automating flows in time for peak season paid dividends right away.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-sygm4yjbdvwv7fdbgulz-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Auto repairs.
