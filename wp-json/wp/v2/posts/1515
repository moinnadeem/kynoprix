Business leaders who accelerated digital transformation out of necessity in 2021 have been pleasantly surprised by AI\u2019s ability to resolve customer service requests and eliminate hold times. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologies like conversational AI specifically have matured exponentially since 2019, and are now apt enough to not only cover pandemic-related business gaps, but add ROI well beyond 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how AI is shaping contact centers of the future:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Staffing Solutions<\/h2>\n<p><b> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compensating for the skills shortages caused by Covid-19 has presented many new challenges of its own. Contact centers, for example, found that training new agents remotely or increasing their investments in business process outsourcing (BPOs) was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/forrester-tei-report-replicant-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time-consuming and expensive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In cases where contact centers needed a contingency plan, conversational AI could deploy in weeks and handle fluctuating call volumes at a fraction of the cost, without impacting the customer experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, conversational AI\u2019s ability to resolve the majority of common customer issues is a ringing example of how AI can increase agent retention by offloading repetitive tasks and freeing agents to leverage their creative and empathetic skills to resolve more complex customer issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAI is already beginning to help fill skills shortages of the existing workforce through career transition support tools,\u201d said Rob Jekielek in the report, managing director with Harris Poll. \u201cAI is also helping employees do their existing and evolving jobs better and faster using digital assistants and in-house AI-driven training programs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Productivity Boosts<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When AI solutions are paired with outcome-driven workflows, business efficiency goes up in unforeseen ways. Conversational AI, for example, doesn\u2019t just resolve tier-1 customer calls, it can intelligently route urgent call types to human agents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, conversational AI can automatically summarize call notes and log them in call centers\u2019 CRMs. It can also support revenue-generating use-cases like automated outbound calls to follow up with customers or remind them of impending renewal dates without requiring time on behalf of agents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these are additional benefits to resolving tier-1 customer service issues that contact centers can\u2019t achieve without the help of automation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost executives (74%) not only anticipate AI will deliver more efficient business processes, but also help to create new business models (55%) and enable the creation of new products and services (54%),\u201d the report found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-conversational-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6190\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheDefinitiveGuide_2501x469-1024x192.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5392\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5392 \" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/cap-media-img08-1024x708-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"415\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-5392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A real-time call breakdown from Replicant\u2019s conversational AI analytics dashboard.<\/p><\/div>\n<h2>Advanced Analytics<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019d be hard pressed to find any remaining industries that aren\u2019t actively leveraging analytics in partnership with AI to better understand their customers and their own success rates in serving them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSince Covid hit, CEOs are now leaning in, asking how they can take advantage of data?\u201d said Arnab Chakraborty in the report, global managing director at Accenture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last few years, analytics tools have sharpened. They used to provide broad-stroke solutions for enterprise operations like supply chain management. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, they have granular use cases, like intelligently understanding when order status requests spike in customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When conversational AI is applied to the contact center, post-call analytics can surface insights into unstructured caller data. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can automatically generate dispositions and tags based on what customers are actually saying, and inform call performance, giving agents and managers better visibility into their most important call drivers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u2018Responsible growth\u2019<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When solutions like conversational AI are placed at the forefront of the customer experience, trust is key. Businesses need to be assured that customer data is protected and customers need to be assured that their experience won\u2019t be sacrificed in the face of business results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s conversational AI partners, for example, place a high emphasis on compliance and customer experiences that prioritize customer satisfaction scores as much as they do business KPIs like reducing average handle times and containment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are in the trust business. We believe one of the key elements of our growth \u2014 the use of technology, data, and artificial intelligence \u2014 must be deployed responsibly,\u201d said Sumeet Chabria in the report, global chief operating officer technology and operations at Bank of America. \u201cAs a part of that, our strategy around AI is Responsible AI; that means being customer led.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Novel Partnerships<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, with AI built for the contact center, the success of adoption rides on more than just the technology. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful AI deployments arrive in tandem with experts who understand the intricacies of telephony systems, conversational design best practices, and know how to deploy at scale to serve millions of unique customers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern AI solutions are built to last by experts who can help companies compete on an innovation level with the best of the best, regardless of their AI expertise, so they too can keep pace with technology.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs the world eventually emerges from the other side of the Covid crisis, there will be opportunities for entrepreneurs, business leaders and innovators to build value and launch new ventures that can be rapidly re-configured and re-aligned as customer needs change,\u201d the report concluded.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, Harvard Business Review reported that AI Adoption Skyrocketed Over the Last 18 Months,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":1518,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Why AI Adoption Skyrocketed in 2021 | Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"According to Harvard Business Review, AI has become a mainstream solution over the last 18 months.
