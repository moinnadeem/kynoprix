But for many of today\u2019s contact centers, there\u2019s simply too many other challenges in play to focus on standing out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s because modern customer service is built on a delicate balance of having just enough agents to service customers, without so many, that costs skyrocket. And recent challenges are persisting: high agent turnover, call volume spikes, and other unpredictable factors severely disrupt this balance, resulting in long wait times, frustrated customers, and overwhelmed agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for contact centers adopting AI Contact Center Automation as a solution, the game has changed. As a pioneer in Contact Center Automation, Replicant helps companies automate tier-1 customer service conversations with equal or higher CSAT as live agents, while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced challenges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine, consumers can engage in natural conversations across voice, messaging, and other digital channels to resolve their customer support issues. Replicant is not another plug-in or widget meant to make agents incrementally faster at performing tasks. It\u2019s a transformative solution that completely changes how businesses look at their contact center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what changes when a contact center uses Replicant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u23ee Before: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spikes in customer demand with long wait times and low agent availability<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2>  After: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24\/7 automated tier-1 resolution, no wait times, and increased agent availability<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers are experiencing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-consequences-of-rising-call-volumes-and-what-to-do-about-it\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unpredictability<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at every turn. Without automation, customers run into lengthy wait times when they need support most, and agents are stretched thin with one call after another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation changes that. It completely automates high-volume, repetitive requests like order updates, appointment changes, and requests for information with zero wait times. Agents are freed to connect with customers who truly need it and given the breathing room to learn new skills and earn higher wages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u23ee Before: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed workforces with solutions that don\u2019t decrease agent workloads<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2>  After: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side-by-side collaboration that optimizes agents\u2019 time\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, customer service agents bear as much \u2013 or more \u2013\u00a0of the burden of the contact center crisis as customers. They\u2019re the ones stuck with more work, more demanding customers, and more juggling in a hybrid environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these agents, most of today\u2019s solutions don\u2019t go far enough to help them. They can allow them to serve customers faster or perform less manual data entry, but they can\u2019t actually augment their day-to-day tasks. Replicant\u2019s solution can. It completely changes agent responsibilities, from taking repetitive calls from sun-up to sun-down to focusing on only a handful of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/why-contact-center-agents-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">important, high-value conversations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and making their jobs more engaging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u23ee Before: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expensive solutions like outsourcing and answering services that drive higher costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2>  After: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">55% average return in cost savings and rapid deployment in weeks, not months<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers have plenty of traditional options to choose from when they want additional staff or incrementally better answering systems. But few, if any, can show true ROI that lowers costs and increases in value over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers get a solution that begins executing thousands of customer conversations in weeks. That\u2019s because Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation solution is purpose-built for customer service and 80% ready to deploy right out of the box.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few short weeks of implementing integrations and customizing conversation scripts for your business, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine begins returning massive value when compared to the cost and time of BPOs or deflection tools like IVRs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u23ee Before: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outdated planning models that lead to inaccurate agent forecasting<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2>  After: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elastic scale and unlimited capacity so contact centers are never stretched thin<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workforce Management (WFM) is the biggest challenge today\u2019s contact centers face. How do you increase your labor pool in the face of record turnover rates? How do you predict how many representatives you\u2019ll need when call volumes can spike at a moment\u2019s notice?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant renders those questions, and more, as completely unnecessary. That\u2019s because it\u2019s elastically scalable. Imagine having a reliable, unlimited source of five-star tier-1 agents who can resolve repetitive requests at any time of day or night. That\u2019s the value Replicant delivers, and the key reason why contact centers who use Replicant are able to completely transform their priorities and WFM strategies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u23ee Before: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declining CSAT with higher average handle times and unpredictable customer experiences<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2>  After: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved CSAT, error rate reduction, and half the average handle time of human agents<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation is only as good as its ability to delight customers and protect your brand. Many automation solutions are able to resolve tier-1 requests, but can\u2019t do so without lengthy handle times and frustrating customer experiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, brands can rest assured that they\u2019re receiving state-of-the-art conversation designs. Customers can state their requests using any language, dialect, or style of speech and expect the same accurate responses in one second or less, no matter the channel they use. Replicant regularly returns lower AHT\u2019s and higher CSAT scores than those of human agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about Replicant\u2019s <\/span><a
