We all know, intuitively, where the \u201cOK\u201d button should be placed and how to close a digital window.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI has gone from a relatively unknown technology to a mainstay in customer service, and we can see the evolution of this discipline play out specifically in contact centers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s changing the way customers get their issues resolved and bringing new efficiencies to the forefront while drastically improving the customer experience. It\u2019s also become a game-changing tool for contact centers to unlock deep customer insights.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this evolution hasn\u2019t been without its lessons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike UI design, there is no already-written book or one-size-fits-all approach to implementing conversational AI in customer service. Expectations and best-case scenarios that may work in a sandbox environment can create more problems than solutions when rolled out to customers at scale, leaving callers frustrated and developers scratching their heads wondering where they went wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve learned that successful conversation design, implementation, and deployment comes down to thinking like a customer and creating conversations that don\u2019t force callers to fit a square peg in a round hole.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a methodology that doesn\u2019t put words in the caller\u2019s mouth and adapts to accommodate even the most unique voice on the other end of the phone line. It\u2019s a unification of the aesthetic utility of conversation design with the actual utility of the powerful AI models that allow the machine to listen, think, and speak.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few of my learnings and best practices for implementing best-in-class conversational AI:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Trust is key.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell the truth about speaking to a machine, with no gimmicks or crutches to cover latency or inaccuracy. A machine that introduces itself with a human name, or uses computerized typing sounds to mimic a call center agent, only confuses the caller and adds time to a conversation \u2013 not value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You don&#8217;t know your conversation drivers until you start measuring them.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should be making decisions based on data rather than relying on hunches or incomplete agent dispositions. Successful conversation design learns from every interaction to better understand what customers want and provides an unbiased view into what use-cases and flows to automate next.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The \u201chappy path\u201d is only the beginning.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Norbert Wiener, MIT professor and originator of the field of Cybernetics, \u201cthe great weakness of the machine&#8230;is that it cannot yet take into account the vast range of probability that characterizes the human situation.\u201d As a corollary, if you only design for what you expect to hear, your callers will end the conversation more frustrated than they began (and likely never call you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use your product again). You need to be able to change the subject, handle multiple intents, collect data while on hold, think ahead, and reference things you said earlier. These are &#8220;easy&#8221; for humans but very difficult for machines, and can make all the difference between success and failure. A well-rounded conversation design accounts for every scenario to avoid escalations or confusion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Each customer has a &#8220;frustration meter&#8221; and when you&#8217;ve filled it up they&#8217;re mashing 0 or asking for an agent.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suffice to say that before Replicant, no one had ever had a very good conversation with a machine. Callers may get frustrated simply after hearing they&#8217;re speaking with a machine. Rather than lie or hide the fact, you should push back with the machine\u2019s true value (\u201cI can get you to an agent, but it looks like there is a 15 minute hold time. In the meantime, can I get your policy number?\u201d) The customer will be in and out before they could even get to an agent and will avoid being locked in \u201cbot land\u201d. They might even learn a thing or two about how smart and fast a well-designed machine can be. If customers want to escalate, let them, but ensure you pass context to the agent so callers don\u2019t have to repeat their account number or why they are calling (I hate when I have to do that!).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Meet the customer where they are.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think of the family in Detroit that can&#8217;t speak to their smart fridge because it doesn&#8217;t understand their accent. Or the cashier in Quebec with a broken POS system who must wait on hold for customer service from a human agent because the automated machine doesn\u2019t understand their vernacular. Meeting the customer comes in many forms that may include jargon (intent models that handle colloquial affirmative phrases like &#8220;you got it, boss&#8221;), accents (custom transcription models that are well balanced and equitable in understanding different pronunciation), common entity extraction (that\u2019s Gleitz \u2013 G as in glass, L as in lightbulb, E as in eagle&#8230;, or even phonetic fuzzy name matching for people with names like mine that may be difficult to spell correctly), and preferred channels (switching to SMS and Flex Form for credit card collection). A conversational AI is only as good as its ability to handle the most unique customer, not the most common.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Deploy continuous improvement&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8230;to learn from every conversation, better handle edge cases, and prevent conversational flows from getting stale. This industry moves rapidly, and so do customer expectations. Conversation designs should automatically improve through machine learning (a process we call \u201ckaizen\u201d) so a customer never runs into the same issue twice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Without test cases you are lost.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it\u2019s time to release a new version of your conversational AI, deployments should be validated with a full suite of regression tests gathered from previous successes and failures. Even simple changes in scripts and call flows can confuse customers and tank success rates. When testing changes, gather feedback from team members or friends who don\u2019t speak or think like you do. If you want to try something new, A\/B test it to validate your assumptions. It&#8217;s the most effective way to turn theories into action and ensure your designs are based in truth and equality, not biased opinion or personal experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Containment isn&#8217;t everything.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s easy to build a terrible experience with excellent containment. Planned transfers and escalations should be part of your gameplan. Measure how successful you are at getting customers where they need to go as efficiently as possible, and make sure when the live agent takes the call you are passing context and providing an automated screen pop so agents can quickly get up to speed where the machine left off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><i>*Bonus: Outbound Calling*<\/i><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Make sure there is a business case.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, no cold calls. Customers often have a negative view of dialing machines as it is, and every word spoken by conversational AI should provide value to customers in solving a problem, not creating a distraction or nuisance via outbound cold calling.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Give something to get something.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t open the call demanding personal information. Explain who you are (a machine calling on behalf of\u2026) and why you&#8217;re calling. Include information that only the business would know before asking for any personal identifying information. There are many out there using conversational AI for nefarious purposes and it\u2019s important to train those you call to practice good habits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Make sure you can navigate IVRs that may answer the call.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you get to a person, your conversational AI might need to press some digits. Make sure this can be done dynamically. Before we know it machines will regularly be speaking with machines. They should both use language \u2013 it&#8217;s easily understood and auditable. Voice <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the API.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Be quick!<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collect multiple pieces of data on the same turn. Be understanding if the person you call doesn\u2019t have time to talk. If necessary, don\u2019t force the issue. Be polite, end the call, and try again later \u2013 you&#8217;ll probably reach a different person at a better time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code
