CAA Clubs provides its members Emergency Roadside Services, complete Travel Services, Member Savings and comprehensive insurance offerings.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Challenge:<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes in Eastern Canada\u2019s weather have included extreme conditions and unpredictable storm surges that wreak havoc on roads. For CCG, that\u2019s made it harder to meet member needs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After challenges with their previous automation solution, CCG was hesitant to commit to another platform but ultimately decided to test Replicant out with credit card payments and updates to explore how their members would respond to the Thinking Machine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Partnership:<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quickly into their initial implementation, CCG saw a significant spike in usage of their automation channel and expanded the Thinking Machine to automate Inbound Emergency Roadside Service (ERS) Calls, and Verbal Copy Calls. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to Replicant, the average handle time for ERS at home was about 11 minutes. Even with background noise and distractions, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine could capture customer information accurately, locate the member, and get a locksmith dispatched in under 5 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Outcome:<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of implementing Replicant, CCG was able to increase elasticity in their call centers and better handle fluctuations in volume from weather events while enabling their agents to focus on highly emotional or complex conversations. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this past winter, when call volume typically spike, Replicant seamlessly scaled up to handle the equivalent call volume of 41 agents. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One member even said, \u201cYour technological device was easy to use and saved me a lot of time. I liked that I was able to update my credit card info, make a payment right away and renew my membership without having to call someone to do it for me. It was smooth sailing! I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past month, CAA has gone live in production with the Thinking Machine\u2019s enhanced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/resources\/events-webinars\/how-to-implement-llms-in-your-contact-center\/\">LLM layer<\/a>, helping resolution rates for their car collection use case soar to 90%.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHaving implemented Replicant, we are prepared for whatever may come.
