That is exactly the kind of scenario that the best omnichannel contact center solutions can provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center technology has evolved beyond simply improved efficiency of phone calls. It is now working toward providing an even more seamless, integrated approach to customer service. Omnichannel contact center solutions offer advanced features that are scalable, vastly improve the customer experience, and help deal with agent shortages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is an omnichannel contact center?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An omnichannel contact center is one that streamlines all customer interactions, regardless of channel, into a single workforce management solution. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/99firms.com\/blog\/live-chat-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, live chat is the number one service choice for shoppers between 18 and 49 years old while <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/99firms.com\/blog\/texting-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Globe Newswire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports that three out of ten people would give up calls in favor of texting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers can now choose to call, text, or chat and an automated system driven by AI can respond. AI-driven contact center technology can retrieve and record the interactions for future use while providing data and analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why is omnichannel customer service important?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Excellent customer satisfaction is harder to achieve with rising consumer expectations. An omnichannel cloud contact center can help improve the customer experience by reducing wait times to zero and eliminating the need for customers to repeat themselves. It also contributes to live agent satisfaction by eliminating repetitive, boring inquiries, leaving them with more complex and challenging customer interactions. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/roi-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation ROI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be significant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does omnichannel routing improve efficiency in the contact center?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omnichannel contact center solutions can improve efficiency by using a single conversation engine. This engine leverages a shared intent library, which deploys and scales conversational AI rapidly across languages and channels for every automated conversation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, these cloud-based call center solutions resolve issues naturally with seamless channel switching across voice, text, chat, and other digital channels. Customers can interact with you when and where they choose.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the omnichannel call center software can analyze conversation transcripts for every customer interaction, regardless of channel. This information is displayed in a single dashboard that makes it easy to get the data you need to drive operational excellence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Getting started<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If setting up an omnichannel cloud contact center sounds too intimidating, it\u2019s easy to get started in stages. You can start by automating a single contact driver over one channel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a hotel may choose to automate overflow reservations during peak vacation season by phone. Once that is working well, that hotel can add new contact drivers such as cancellations or billing requests. In addition, new channels such as text messaging or web chats can be folded into the AI contact center at a later time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of an auto insurance business, the highest priority may be to automate tax form information requests during one quarter of each year. Focusing on automating only that contact driver across all channels may relieve the company of enough volume to avoid hiring additional or temporary live agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Expected results<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides improving customer service, reducing or eliminating wait times, and retaining more live agents in a tight labor market, omnichannel contact center solutions can be expected to see a significant return on investment. Replicant\u2019s enterprise contact centers regularly return more than 55 percent in cost savings when compared to the cost of highly optimized business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Our Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re ready to embrace contact center technology in an omnichannel environment, we\u2019d love to show you how <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/roi-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact center automation ROI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can greatly benefit your customers, agents, and bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Imagine your customers ordering a product on your website and your company is able to&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":3502,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Omnichannel Contact Center Solutions That Work - Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Explore Replicant\u2019s omnichannel contact center solutions, how they will improve your call center&#039;s efficiency and why they are important.
