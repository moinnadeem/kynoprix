He\u2019s led strategies that have reimagined digital channels, the client experience, and business operations and seen these efforts through from start to finish.<\/p>\n<p>As companies look to keep up with rapidly changing consumer behavior and expectations, they\u2019re investing more in digitally transforming their business. However, digital transformation is a huge undertaking and creates change that typically isn\u2019t welcomed. To help business and customer service leaders succeed with this, Kugathasan joined us to share his tips on how to bring innovation and digital transformation to your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Tie your innovation initiatives to company goals<\/h2>\n<p>In order to get your innovation initiatives off the ground, you need your senior leadership and team on board. You need buy-in from senior leadership so you can get the resources you need. To do this, Kugathasan says you need to tell a good story and align yourself with the broader mandate of the organization. \u201cHow can you tie your story of innovation or what you want to do as a project or a series of projects into that type of story, rather than just saying we want to innovate. I think that\u2019s where people get things wrong in the first place.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Get team adoption by taking people on the digital transformation journey with you<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got senior leadership on board, now you need to get the team behind you too. Kugathasan sees similar principles between getting senior leadership and team buy-in, but what\u2019s different between the two is their underlying motivation.<\/p>\n<p>To motivate team members, some companies have taken the carrot and stick approach. Team members have to carry out the initiative. Otherwise, there will be consequences. But Kugathasan has a different perspective:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>People want to do something interesting in their day-to-day. Bringing them along that journey as you\u2019re improving that client experience gives people in the team level a lot of different things.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Innovation presents opportunities for people to build new skills, work on new projects and tasks, and flex their muscles. \u201cFinding those right motivators in that team level is important or equally as important as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/four-tips-for-successfully-implementing-ai-and-automation-at-the-enterprise-level\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">executing on that project<\/a>,\u201d adds Kugathasan.<\/p>\n<h2>Overcome risk-averse and skeptical stakeholders by figuring out their underlying assumptions<\/h2>\n<p>When facing people who are resistant to change, Kugathasan sees negativity and skepticism as the result of underlying assumptions. Getting to the root of those assumptions and finding ways to prove them out in smaller increments is the key to working with risk-averse or negative stakeholders. And whether their assumptions are true or not, \u201cwe still owe it to ourselves to test.\u201d In these situations, Kugathasan often asks himself:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Is it better that we\u2019re doing things exactly the same or do we owe it to ourselves to test something different or try something different?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When you start this dialogue with those teammates or stakeholders, you\u2019ll find they\u2019re often open to giving you their perspective. In Kugathasan\u2019s experience, there\u2019s very few people who are negative just for the sake of being negative. But if you do run into someone like that, Kugathasan recommends corralling everyone around that person to bring them on board. People are willing to follow a plan their peers accept, even if they don\u2019t accept it themselves.<\/p>\n<p>So the next time you encounter a negative or risk-averse stakeholder, understand whether their negativity stems from a valid reason and see if you can find a solution. Otherwise, look at the ecosystem and the people around them. If everyone else is on board, ask them why they aren\u2019t too. However, Kugathasan offers the reminder that there\u2019s a number of different ways to approach this and the best method will depend on each person\u2019s role within an organization.<\/p>\n<h2>Mapping out and understanding your business processes is a prerequisite to rapidly modernizing your business<\/h2>\n<p>Fast tracking the modernization or transformation of your business relies on two things, according to Kugathasan.<\/p>\n<p>The first is how well you understand all the moving parts of the business \u2014 the core functions and the underlying technology and infrastructure. To do this, Kugathasan recommends mapping out your business processes at a high level. If you were asked to put together a simple one-pager on each business function and the processes and technology that tie them all together, would you be able to do so? If you can\u2019t, you need to start with this exercise. Then, plan on refreshing it annually.<\/p>\n<p>The second is how \u201cyou envision and start to construct a path to either build on top of it or to replace each of those pieces with better and faster parts or much more efficient parts.\u201d Kugathasan compares an organization to a car. You can change the engine, frame, wheels, and other parts to make a car go faster. This achieves your goal for speed without having to buy a new car. The different parts of a car are like the technologies, interfaces, and channels used in your processes. The key to fast tracking modernization is understanding how all of these different parts connect and then identifying opportunities to improve upon them.<\/p>\n<h2>Innovation thrives or dies based on company culture<\/h2>\n<p>When asked what the biggest obstacle to innovation is, culture immediately came to mind for Kugathasan. \u201cInnovation in any organization comes from a central mandate, and that mandate needs to come from the top-down. Building that culture of self-improvement is really a value that\u2019s nurtured by senior leadership. Without that, you\u2019re not going to be able to sustain any sort of innovation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t just say you\u2019re going to be an innovative company and try something new once in a while. Companies need to put substantial effort into innovation, including allocating funding and resources to it. Also, \u201cYou need to foster this culture of innovation to make sure it\u2019s not just a one-time event.\u201d Innovation goes beyond doing a single project or working for a few months to solve a problem. \u201cInnovation, I think, is a continuous journey. And the foundation of that is culture,\u201d says Kugathasan.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/archive\/ama-cx-innovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Hear more from Kugathasan in this on-demand discussion<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0about championing innovation and disrupting customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to engage with and learn from digital transformation leaders like Val Kugathasan,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/replicant-events\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up to be notified of upcoming Replicant events.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Val Kugathasan, Director of Digital Transformation and Payment Operations at ADP, has spent years evangelizing&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":1469,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
