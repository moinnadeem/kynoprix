In 2022, they serviced almost 1.4 million calls across three contact centers. ECSI partnered with Replicant to deploy a Front Desk solution to authenticate, route, and resolve customer calls. As a result, they&#8217;ve been able to navigate rising demand and hiring challenges while driving savings and efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Industry<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Financial Services<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Use Case: <\/b>Front Desk (Tax form processing, Refunds, Loan servicing)<\/li>\n<li><b>Annual Call Volume: <\/b>1.4 Million<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAutomation has become integral to what we do. Our business is dramatically different today with Replicant. It\u2019s really made a difference in our employees\u2019 lives and the experience from the borrowers and parents who call us, as well as how we run our business\u201d &#8211; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mike Bowman, Senior Director, Operations, ECSI<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Replicant Flattens Spikes During Busy Seasons<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine currently serves three of ECSI\u2019s core products: tax form processing, refunds, and loan servicing. These flows are all highly seasonal, peaking in the summer and winter months. The Thinking Machine was deployed to gather caller intents, authenticate customers, and contain or route them appropriately. This led to transformational benefits an IVR couldn\u2019t provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some of the key benefits include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlimited seasonal elasticity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analytics for every caller intent<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natural conversations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24\/7 no-wait service<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLast year&#8217;s biggest win for us wasn&#8217;t just the $1.5 million dollars we saved with automation. The Thinking Machine is really good at collecting information to show us what our obstacles are and where people get stuck. We can use that data to design a better process, to design a better website, to start new solutions.\u201d &#8211; <\/span>Mike Bowman<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Results That Speak for Themselves<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ECSI didn\u2019t just look at traditional KPIs to measure the success of Replicant. They surveyed customers who were contained by the Thinking Machine as well as callers who spoke to an agent. They found customer satisfaction was almost identical between the two. For calls that the Thinking Machine couldn\u2019t contain, ECSI\u2019s handle times still dropped during escalations. With Replicant at the \u201cFront Desk,\u201d the Thinking Machine authenticates customers, gathers initial information, and passes a summary to each agent, saving thousands of minutes each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformational Impact:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40% decrease in escalation handle times\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% faster agent response times<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.5M in annual savings<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe reason you got our businesses is because you&#8217;re honest, straightforward and responsive. You were very inclusive with my team, showing them how things work and making them part of the build process. There was just a lot of transparency, openness, honest. You would hope this isn&#8217;t true, but you just don&#8217;t see that everywhere.\u201d &#8211; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mike Bowman<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"om-rprvyloulhnry9a8okzz-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who is ECSI?
