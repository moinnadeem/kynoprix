According to the IBM Learning Center, IVR is \u201can automated telephone system that combines pre-recorded messages or text-to-speech technology with a dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) interface to engage callers, allowing them to provide and access information without a live agent.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the system is not able to provide the right information, IVR can help route callers to a live agent for further assistance. When the technology was first introduced, it was a solid way to integrate computer and telephony technologies in order to begin streamlining the flow of calls, decrease caller wait times, and boost customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as machine learning technologies became more advanced, IVR solutions tended to frustrate customers more than please them. Five years ago, an article in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jasonbloomberg\/2017\/12\/27\/reinventing-interactive-voice-response-for-the-digital-era\/?sh=322ee5b0722e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">explored the role of IVR in the digital era. The article explained that IVR initially served as a barrier between customers and customer service representatives to reduce call center volume. \u201cFor a predigital enterprise, call centers are simply cost centers, and every second a call center representative is on the phone is money down the drain,\u201d the article said. However, today, digital enterprises must use every interaction, including calls, to delight customers and make a positive impression. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/conversational-ivr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational IVR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is call center outsourcing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call center outsourcing is a common strategy that is frequently used by contact centers that want efficient customer service. The idea is to leverage a third-party company to assist with customer service calls. These third-party organizations are often offshore and may be engaged to handle overflow or a specific type of customer service phone call. The idea is to create efficient customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the pros and cons of old-school IVR?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Older IVR\u2019s do provide operational benefits such as lowered call volumes and accurate call routing. However, they can negatively impact customer satisfaction and loyalty because they can be somewhat clunky, require the customer to repeat themselves, and cannot understand multiple\u00a0 customer intents if they are said in the same sentence. Conversational IVR, on the other hand, can fully resolve issues while also having the ability to intelligently route or escalate calls that require an agent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of new conversational IVR for efficient customer service?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational IVR creates a more efficient customer service solution. New, machine learning technology like Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine gives call centers the ability to fully resolve customer service calls without staffing additional live agents. It is unlimitedly scalable, making it an excellent choice for call centers that have variable volumes. It is available 24\/7 and delivers zero hold times, which contributes to delighted, long-term, loyal customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the best first contact with a customer?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, customer expectations are extremely high. They want efficient customer service. They need their question answered and their problems solved as quickly as possible. Call centers that can deliver that level of customer service will make customers happy and foster long-term loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers expect their first touch in a service call to be productive. Old IVRs often cannot quickly authenticate customer accounts, answer questions completely, or speak naturally with a customer. Conversational AI, on the other hand, is less rigid and can be customized and edited by contact centers within seconds. Conversational AI goes beyond outdated IVRs, fully resolving customer calls with zero hold times, anytime and any day.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s IVR Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about Replicant\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/conversational-ivr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conversational IVR solution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
