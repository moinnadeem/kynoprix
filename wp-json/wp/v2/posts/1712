While the potential benefits of conversational AI are clear \u2013 staffing solutions, higher CSAT scores, eliminated hold times \u2013 so too are the risks of building it yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the upfront costs of a dedicated in-house development team, a months to years-long project timeline, and numerous integration requirements, the downstream costs of building conversational AI in-house far outweigh those of working with a solution provider.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are some of the most common, though under-discussed, costs businesses incur when they try to build their own conversational AI solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Production ineffectiveness<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a stark difference between successfully building a conversational AI solution, and deploying a conversational AI solution that is actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successful<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at what it\u2019s designed to do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many conversational AI solutions can perform exceptionally well\u00a0 in a controlled environment. However, once deployed, conversational AI\u2019s effectiveness can struggle when met with real-world challenges like accents, noisy environments, and customers who use slang instead of traditional keywords.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are unlimited scenarios that can happen when a customer picks up the phone and a conversational AI is unprepared for the unpredictable. Conversational AI is a highly complex technology that requires both an understanding of your business as well as elegantly designed conversational linguistics in order to be effective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The cost: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a team of ML engineers, AI experts, and best-in-class natural language processing and QA practices, an ineffective solution can end up <\/span>costing<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">valuable agent time as escalations increase and customer patience runs thin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant difference:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Replicant\u2019s out-of-the-box conversational AI is purpose-built for customer service. This means there is no scenario that the Thinking Machine hasn\u2019t already encountered, and subsequently mastered. We never outsource development or implementations, meaning the effectiveness of your product is never at risk and your customer brand is always accounted for. The Thinking Machine also leverages pre-built powers that can be dragged and dropped to scale conversations and A\/B test new flows with ease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Frustrating conversation design<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective conversational AI \u2013 that is, its ability to fully resolve customer issues or intelligently route customers to the right place \u2013 still doesn\u2019t guarantee customer satisfaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAT is most often correlated to a fast, natural experience. In order to create this, conversations must be designed for quick turns between human and machine speakers. AI must allow customers to ask multiple questions at once and have the continuous learning ability to pick up on new styles of speech.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The cost: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor conversation design can lead to numerous CSAT issues. Without in-house experts in both machine learning and the principles of conversational design, customers interacting with poorly designed AI will find themselves repeating questions or conforming to robotic styles of speech as they would with a traditional IVR.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine boasts a below-one-second <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">latency between turns in a conversation and over a 94% inference accuracy. For the customer, these factors mean they can speak quickly, ask multiple questions right up front, and often end up getting their issue resolved faster than they could with a live agent leading to CSAT scores on par or better than humans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A black box of analytics<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A modern conversational AI solution doesn\u2019t guarantee modern analytics. In fact, building an analytics platform to capture customer conversations, surface insights, and unlock actionable recommendations is a project unto itself. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers interested in building their own conversational AI should be certain they can leverage the data it will create to avoid having a black box of analytics.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The cost: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without full analytics capabilities, contact centers who build conversational AI won\u2019t have access to data around what\u2019s working, what needs improvement, and whether or not your solution is successful. And without fully built self-service options, low analytics capabilities will cost contact centers time when they want to edit scripts or respond to customer trends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact center leaders get visibility into all customer support conversations through an end-to-end dashboard. Once the Thinking Machine begins taking calls, contact center managers can instantly monitor conversations, analyze insights from unstructured conversation data, and take action immediately with self-service script editing to create an optimal customer experience fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Insufficient redundancies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI is a leading solution for staffing challenges and unpredictable call volumes in the contact center. However, this only amplifies the importance of back-up planning during inevitable outages and rising DDoS attacks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When building a solution, make sure your redundancy planning can stack up with the best out-of-the-box solutions that often include layers of fail-safes that eliminate the costly risks of downtimes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The cost:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Without a backup plan for climate, cybercrime, and outage-driven downtimes, insufficient redundancies can lead to a litany of problems. Hold times can skyrocket, data can be compromised, and astronomical human hours can all follow a poorly timed conversational AI outage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Replicant Difference: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s platform provides high-availability infrastructure for every customer that runs 24\/7 with efficient load balancing across thousands of concurrent calls. With multiple layers of redundancy, even the largest and most prolonged outages mean the Thinking Machine provides always-on support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><center><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action
