They\u2019ve been used throughout the industry in some form for a while now, helping agents receive calls, matching customers to the right department, and making it easier to automate call transcription.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as call volumes grow, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-replicant-2021-contact-center-survey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer expectations skyrocket<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and hiring challenges persist, it\u2019s never been more important for industry leaders to distinguish between the types of intelligence available in the market today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a breakdown of three of the most impactful technologies commonly leveraged in call centers, from the traditional to the cutting edge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Call Routing<\/h2>\n<p><b>What it does<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common form of call center intelligence is very basic: routing solutions like interactive voice response (IVR) and frontend menus that transfer callers to applicable agents, deflect to other self-service resources, or attempt to contain calls with packaged answers to keyword-driven questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, in these instances, the customer might say they have a payment question, so the IVR routes them to the billing department, an online or app-based page, or attempts to answer the question itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Routing solutions like these replace older menu systems that asked callers to press \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d for select services, or flows that would autoplay long, rigid menus. Some routing solutions can even perform back-office functions like data entry and act as virtual agents for specific tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where it falls short:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What dates this form of \u201cintelligence\u201d is its user experience. The solution was initially designed to make the most of hold times and prevent agents from having to extract initial customer intents. Now, it often leads to frustrated callers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In routing-oriented solutions, for example, an IVR may understand that a customer\u2019s question can be resolved through the organization&#8217;s app. In response, it prompts the customer to open their smartphone\u2019s app store, download an app, and create an account.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5790 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Customer-Service-Issues-300x206.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"661\" height=\"454\" \/><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from essentially creating four more steps for the customer, this solution doesn\u2019t consider that the caller could have been driving during the call, or might not have a strong enough connection on their phone to download an app, leading to more rather than fewer inefficiencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What seemed to both the customer and IVR as a simple request now leaves the caller feeling like they\u2019ve just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wasted<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> time by contacting customer service and can\u2019t get answers through their preferred channel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public expectations of human-to-machine interactions have changed. If the experience isn\u2019t as simple as talking to their smartphone or at-home virtual assistant, brands are already fighting an uphill battle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Transcription automation<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b>What it does:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call center conversations are often referred to as black boxes of data that industry leaders struggle to \u201copen up\u201d to leverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transcription intelligence does the work of automatically putting these conversations into writing so they don\u2019t gather dust in audio files. This unlocks customer interactions for fast, data-driven analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many legacy CCaaS providers have implemented transcription services as part of their core technology. This added layer brings the same technology built for personal solutions like countertop and smartphone assistants to the contact center. It adds greater visibility into contact center operations and customer data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where it falls short:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transcription intelligence gets closer to modern AI solutions with a ubiquitous and effective solution for processing natural language. But the technology isn\u2019t built for customer service specifically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General transcription often struggles with names, alphanumeric strings, and numbers because it&#8217;s not advanced enough to handle complex, human-like conversations with a customer. In fact, these interactions aren\u2019t expected to be necessary in the typical conversations that these transcription solutions are built for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many transcription bots can also be static, transcribing what they hear to the best of their ability without adding new intents, words, or synonyms to their dictionary. Inference accuracy and, by association, customer satisfaction, goes down the longer a bot stays online without improving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another stark example of the difference between the theoretical benefits of adding intelligence to contact centers and the actualized benefit of the technology. Leaders should look for intelligence solutions that improve agents\u2019 toolsets and call centers\u2019 data while also getting better with every call.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Conversational AI<\/h2>\n<p><b>What it does:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third category of contact center intelligence is conversational AI which represents the cutting edge of industry technologies available today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI is artificial intelligence turned up to 100%. It can fully resolve customer requests without having to reroute calls. It can transcribe customer service-specific requests and also intelligently tag success rates. And it can distinguish multiple intents and dispositions in fractions of a second\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-improve with each interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology has come a long way since its inception and adopters are seeing transformational changes not just in how their employees, phone systems, and data management work, but how customers, agents and internal systems come together to create efficiencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where it stands out:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practically, there\u2019s a night and day difference between conversational AI and routing or transcription solutions. Gone are sentences like \u201cIf you\u2019re calling to speak to X say or press Y,\u201d replaced instead with a machine learning brain that instantly understands the difference between one intent, multiple intents, entities, and the relationships between them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sentence like \u201cI\u2019d like to update my credit card, add a new address,\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> order a large pizza with pepperoni, olives, and gluten-free crust\u201d can get a 100% accurate response from conversational AI without a delay. Call centers have identified this ability as a crucial benefit for customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI transcription is also purpose-built for names, alphanumeric strings, email addresses, numbers, and other customer-specific interactions. It can accurately intake these items while performing precise entity extraction at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, since conversational AI is purpose-built for contact centers, the solution is essentially ready for production when a call center purchases it. There\u2019s no need to spend months or years perfecting a customized solution, or adding third-party AI on top of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this summary scratches the surface of conversational AI\u2019s capabilities, the main takeaway should be this: <\/span><b>the degree of intelligence directly impacts the user experience<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same way that two websites built on the same platform can yield one extremely frustrating experience and one simple, elegant experience, conversational design can make or break a customer\u2019s call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between solutions that have been around for years and conversational AI is that the former is built to bridge gaps and add marginal improvements to contact centers while the latter is designed to completely transform contact center and customer experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-conversational-ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img
