The unpredictability of hold times can be maddening for a customer, but call volumes also present challenges for businesses looking to quickly scale service based on need at any given time. \u201cThe other problem,\u201d Shamia explains, \u201c is that people don\u2019t want to do this work anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/0AEhqRjHOVqujwj9wwOk1R?utm_source=generator&amp;t=378\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The agents on the other side are not really interested in getting minimum wage to sit and hear people screaming at them on the phone all day long.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Overcoming automation hesitancy<\/h2>\n<p>After years of clunky experiences interacting with traditional IVR systems, people may be hesitant to engage with the intelligent machines being employed in customer service. Shamia explains that exposing people\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-best-contact-center-solutions-explained\/\">to machines actually solving requests<\/a>\u00a0is the first step in improving this perception. Fortunately, most calls have a clear path for a machine to guide customers to achieve a positive resolution \u2013 freeing agents to assist people with more complex needs that require empathy and creativity.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/0AEhqRjHOVqujwj9wwOk1R?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0&amp;t=648\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lucky for us and all our customers, 60-70% of the calls\u2026 have a clear conversion path, which means we can create immediate relief for companies and allow agents to really focus on where they can make a difference.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Building safety into the system<\/h2>\n<p>Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machines are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-contact-center-automation-is-different-from-other-solutions\/\">designed with the safety of callers in mind<\/a>\u00a0and to never \u201clock people in what we call a botland,\u201d explains Shamia. In the case of a roadside assistance call, for example, the Thinking Machine will always ask whether a child or pet is locked in a car and never become distracted or forget this crucial safety inquiry. The Thinking Machine also doesn\u2019t punish callers for impatient behavior. \u201cWe don\u2019t care if you scream at us or not,\u201d says Shamia. If a customer truly needs immediate help and asks for an agent, the machine will always transfer the call.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/0AEhqRjHOVqujwj9wwOk1R?utm_source=generator&amp;t=967\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So far, over the more than 30 million calls, there was no case where we\u2019ll mishandle something in a way that got anyone even close to a harmful situation.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>The evolution of call deflection<\/h2>\n<p>For many in the contact center space, diverting calls away from agents is a goal to reduce costs and call volumes. At Replicant, the goal in most cases is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/contact-centers-before-and-after-deploying-replicant\/\">to facilitate a constructive interaction with the machine<\/a>\u00a0with a slight nudge to encourage the caller-machine conversation. A typical way to do this is to share the wait time with a caller who wants to speak with an agent and ask if they\u2019d like to hold or try to resolve their request. \u201cAnd most customers will actually say, \u2018I\u2019ll go ahead and give it a try,&#8217;\u201d Shamia says. \u201cAnd in most cases, we\u2019re going to resolve it and we don\u2019t have to transfer it to an agent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/0AEhqRjHOVqujwj9wwOk1R?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0&amp;t=1112\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only 5% of the callers ask for an agent. That\u2019s it.

Not only will the reliance on machines to address mundane aspects of the job improve the quality of the work by allowing agents to focus on the more nuanced needs of their customers, but it has been proven over time that automation leads to the emergence of new types of jobs in response. \u201cAs you free up capacity, what businesses tend to do is reinvest it in different ways to increase their revenue and value for their shareholders,\u201d Shamia explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the customer service space as well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/0AEhqRjHOVqujwj9wwOk1R?utm_source=generator&amp;t=2053\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The jobs of the agents is just going to transfer and change because companies are going to be more complex.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<section class=\"blog-detail-section\">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"blog-content\">\n<p>Learn more about how automation is transforming customer service with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/2022-benchmark-report-automation-in-the-contact-center\/\">Replicant\u2019s 2022 Benchmark Report<\/a>\u00a0\u2013 a survey of more than 300 industry leaders on their feelings toward automation.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<aside class=\"cta cta--form cta--medium-purple \">\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"desc\">\n<div class=\"block-left\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/aside>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Replicant co-founder and CEO Gadi Shamia recently joined the\u00a0AI and the Future of Work podcast\u00a0for&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":3171,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
