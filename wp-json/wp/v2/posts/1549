One way that successful companies can deal with these modern challenges and improve their competitive advantage is through business process outsourcing (BPO).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/information-technology\/glossary\/business-process-outsourcing-bpo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, BPO is defined as\u00a0 \u201cthe delegation of one or more IT-intensive business processes to an external provider that, in turn, owns, monitors and manages the selected processes based on defined and measurable performance metrics.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One common example in the business process outsourcing industry is using a third-party vendor to manage an external call center, either completely or partially, to handle overflow. Conversational artificial intelligence driven technology also plays a role in this BPO.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can BPO help my business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a BPO can help businesses scale up staff or completely offload tasks. For a small business, a BPO vendor may handle tasks related to accounting, human resources, or customer call centers, allowing them to scale and grow more quickly. Larger businesses often use BPOs to add staff during seasonal peaks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the advantages of business process outsourcing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BPO solutions may lower the risk of adding staff while supporting organizations on an as-needed basis. They typically don\u2019t require resources such as office space or equipment to get started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, AI-driven solutions can reduce call center costs as businesses typically pay for only the services they need. Learn more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/products\/replicant-voice\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how conversational AI works<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BPO Benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any solution, BPO services can benefit the right business at the right time. Here are some of the most common benefits that companies experience:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Reduced Overhead<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If a BPO takes over a call center completely, that relieves the business of hiring staff, creating infrastructure, and implementing technology.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Specialized Expertise<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Although a BPO company will require training in your business, presumably, they will be experts at running call centers in general. Since these are their core business functions, they typically invest in the latest technology and processes on a large scale, passing along that value to clients.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Rapid Solution to Overflow<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Busy seasons and other expected peaks in volume can be handled efficiently and quickly by BPOs who can step in to reduce hold times for a few weeks or months without long-term investment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>24\/7 Service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For smaller organizations that cannot afford to staff around the clock but who compete with those who do, BPOs can provide that always-available offering.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Transfer Liability<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Businesses can shift risks and liabilities to a third-party BPO who then becomes responsible for agent turnover, compliance, security, and other call center challenges.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BPO Cautions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is definitely a benefit from outsourcing operations, businesses pursuing this direction will want to take into consideration some potential downfalls as well:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Training Costs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since BPOs are external resources, companies can incur significant training costs when outsourcing business operations to ensure that customer-facing BPOs get up to speed in order to prevent a disjointed customer experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>High Turnover<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/qatc.org\/winter-2015-connection\/exploring-call-center-turnover-numbers\/?_ga=2.127448900.891897519.1632825098-921470536.1632825098\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality Assurance &amp; Training Connection<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, call center turnover rates are between 30 percent and 45 percent. That number could be higher if a BPO call center is used because those employees have even less of a stake in the client company.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Poor Long-Term Solution<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Although BPOs <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can offer quick answers to immediate staff shortages in call center operations, they often don\u2019t solve long-term problems. Modern conversational AI, in comparison, is advanced enough to step in for call center staff shortages, while offering economies of scale and more predictable and controllable usage costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Loss of Control<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In exchange for third-party BPO expertise, you turn over some control of agent behavior and, as a result, manage customer experience.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Language Barriers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Outsourcing call center operations may often bring to mind working with low-cost offshore staff that do not have English as their first or primary language. Language and cultural barriers can cause customer frustration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Security Risks<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.securelink.com\/news\/51-of-organizations-have-experienced-a-data-breach-caused-by-a-third-party-new-report-finds\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SecureLink<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, more than half of all companies have faced a data breach caused by a third-party vendor.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI vs. BPO Solutions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizations may want to consider conversational AI solutions as a complement to or a replacement for in-person call center BPOs. These solutions can offer fully branded experiences that take the guesswork out of call scripts and escalation processes. Purpose-built conversational AI can fully resolve tier-1 customer service calls, improve agent retention by offloading repetitive calls, and reduce costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More complicated calls can be transferred to experienced agents, either internally or to a BPO partner, for resolution. The best AI-driven solutions will provide call history, automated conversation transcripts and other background information, which allows a live agent to pick up with the AI-agent left off, improving overall customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/conversational-ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conversational AI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, contact us now to schedule a demo of our proven AI-driven call center solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><center><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Can Business Process Outsourcing Help My Business?
