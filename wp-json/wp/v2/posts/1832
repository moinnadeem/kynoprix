While some leaders remain skeptical about its effectiveness, a study by Fortune indicates that businesses, by refusing to take advantage of this powerful tool, severely cripple themselves and impair future growth and success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe sooner business leaders across all industries understand and take advantage of what AI and data have to offer, the quicker they will reap the rewards,\u201d the article concludes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what does this mean for successful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-to-manage-a-remote-call-center\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call center management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? While AI provides numerous benefits in many areas of business, artificial intelligence in call centers is particularly effective. When AI assists customer service, results are incredible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>AI Versus Traditional Bots<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional, rule-based bots are based on pre-programmed responses and can\u2019t understand context or intent. On the other hand, intelligent virtual agents (IVA) use AI, machine learning, and natural language processing to interact with customers, answer questions, and resolve issues. IVAs solve the customer service problems bots used to run into by using vast amounts of data to provide personalized service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer support solutions like Replicant\u2019s are now just as productive as live agents. Contact center AI uses automation to manage conversations without hold times. Instead of being forced to use a keypad or keywords to communicate, customers are able to speak normally. Finally, IVAs constantly collect information, \u201clearning\u201d from past conversations to improve client management in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Effects of Introducing AI<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe AI market remains in an evolutionary state,\u201d states an article by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2021-09-07-gartner-identifies-four-trends-driving-near-term-artificial-intelligence-innovation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This may be one of the reasons some companies are hesitant about implementing AI-based customer support solutions. As a result, it\u2019s beneficial to look at exactly how implementing AI has impacted real businesses and customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding AI to existing call center solutions has been shown to decrease operational costs by 59 percent. Additionally, 75 percent of consumers spend more money on companies that use AI. Juniper Research predicts that AI is expected to save businesses up to $8 billion <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When call centers start using contact center AI, agents will be able to hand over their more mundane tasks to automation, and efficiency and profits will increase. At the same time, customer satisfaction will skyrocket. By augmenting live agents with AI-based automation, companies will see faster service times, reduced costs, and improved client management.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Does AI Customer Support Really Work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, yes. With minimal training data, contact center AI is able to ramp from zero to 30,000 conversations per day in six weeks. It regularly achieves a 90 percent success rate in resolutions without escalations. Even in situations where conversations need to be handed over to a live agent, AI saves time by gathering information and making it accessible to the agent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI allows companies to offer the efficient and responsive support their customers are looking for, with quick, accurate help and eliminated hold times. Customer service teams also appreciate the increased efficiency, accuracy, and satisfaction AI brings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s Contact Center AI Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019d like to see for yourself, Replicant\u2019s solution and our\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/intelligent-virtual-agent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intelligent virtual agent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> autonomously resolves customer issues with zero hold time.
