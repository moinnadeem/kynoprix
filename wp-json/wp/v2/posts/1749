It\u2019s not just a routing solution, or an agent assist tool, or a chatbot \u2013 it\u2019s a comprehensive automation platform built to serve customers and collaborate with employees without sacrificing CSAT.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a transformative solution that contact centers and customer service agents love. Five reasons why:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. It takes care of the repetitive calls<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine acts as a first line of defense for contact centers by completely resolving tier-1 customer requests with the most natural sounding human-to-machine conversations ever crafted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant doesn\u2019t aim to displace your existing contact center or human agents, rather we do what machines are good at: taking care of repetitive and mundane work and letting human agents respond to calls that require more empathy and creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the agent, this means more of their time is used on engaging customer interactions and conversations that allow them to establish relationships with creativity and empathy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. It automates the back office work<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant doesn\u2019t just automate customer requests, it automatically transcribes conversations, tags channels and intents, and compiles data for easy, non-manual reporting. Agents working in a multi-channel environment no longer have to search through calls, texts, and chats to investigate request histories \u2013 they can see entire interactions in one single thread.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant also seamlessly integrates with the most common contact centers, e-commerce platforms, CRMs, and custom-built proprietary technologies and platforms. These integrations allow the Thinking Machine to make record updates, open support tickets, authenticate customers, and more \u2013\u00a0all on its own. Agents are able to spend more time with the customer and less time watching administrative duties pile up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. It sets customers up for success<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine never aims to prevent a customer from speaking to an agent. Our contact center integrations make it possible to seamlessly escalate and transfer calls to a live agent. In these instances, relevant context is sent to the agent\u2019s console, including caller information, the reason for transfer, and auto-generated, detailed call summary notes. Agents can now understand what steps were taken prior to call escalations, so they don\u2019t waste time repeating the same prompts and inadvertently frustrating customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also more accurately routes customers to the correct lines of business, eliminating downstream issues caused by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/5-reasons-to-break-up-with-your-dated-ivr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inaccurate IVRs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and bringing agents happier customers who have already made progress in getting their requests addressed. This is even more important in an environment where up to 81% of customers have recently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.callcentrehelper.com\/ivr-negatively-affect-customer-experience-149778.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">abandoned a call<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to a frustrating IVR experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. It\u2019s always getting smarter<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s solution isn\u2019t built to require constant maintenance and attention in order to remain state-of-the-art. The Thinking Machine collects knowledge from every call in a central neural network that becomes smarter over time so that customer conversations improve without needing to deploy new call scripts. When you work with Replicant, you also acquire an experienced team regularly optimizing and testing new scripts or call flows requiring little effort from your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means agents don\u2019t have to worry about an automation solution that slips or loses efficacy over time, which would cause more escalations for tier-1 requests. It also means Replicant\u2019s analytics dashboard can automatically surface unsupported call flows that are ripe for automation. The sooner Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine is online, the sooner it can begin optimizing how your contact center makes the most of agent time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Less stress, more time<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to offer agents growth opportunities and professional development time when every shift is a non-stop barrage of calls, texts, and chats for up to 10 hours at a time. But with Replicant, contact centers get the breathing room to offer agents time to upskill, earn certifications, and even learn the ins and outs of conversation analysis through Replicant\u2019s end-to-end dashboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine can scale to handle an infinite amount of requests at once, 24\/7,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact centers can begin to schedule smarter with an always-on, infinitely scalable solution. Managers using Replicant rely less on forecasting models that attempt to predict call volumes and instead optimize their workforce management around agents while the Thinking Machine stays ready to take overflow calls or unpredictable spikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These days, there\u2019s no shortage of
