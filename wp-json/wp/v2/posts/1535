A lot of us would probably rank a call center agent as one of these. Politely answering questions from cranky customers all day? Wow. But I\u2019d say that one job that might actually be tougher, is being the contact center leader who has to hire, train and retain these agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic, and post pandemic (or whatever period we\u2019re in), only made this job more difficult. Contact centers are under enormous pressure, and they are starting to buckle. And consumers are noticing. Recently, Replicant partnered with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dynata.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynata<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to conduct a survey on contact centers, how they\u2019re performing, and what other solutions consumers are willing to engage with to improve their experience. The results were fascinating &#8211; some of the data confirmed issues we\u2019ve all seen in the market. Other data was more surprising. You can link to these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/survey-the-effects-of-bad-customer-service-and-how-brands-can-fix-it\/\">findings<\/a> to get the full rundown, but here are some of the more important findings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Poor Customer Service is Pervasive&#8230;and the Pandemic Didn\u2019t Help<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, some not too surprising data. Customer service has been sliding. It started during the pandemic, and kept going. 70% of respondents indicated it is harder to reach someone (in customer service) than before the pandemic. And 91% said they have experienced poor customer service in the past 6 months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know this. We\u2019ve experienced this. But the alarming point for brands is that 75% of respondents also indicated that poor customer service gives a negative impression of a brand. And, while no industry was immune to poor customer service, the travel industry saw a significant impact on consumer behavior with 25% of travelers saying they\u2019ve rethought future travel plans because of poor service. Yikes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Waiting is the Hardest Part<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking back over all experiences with customer service over the past six months, respondents noted long wait times, needing to re-explain issues several times and being transferred between agents as the top challenges they\u2019ve experienced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The length of hold time matters when it comes to the emotions of customers. The research shows 44% of people report being annoyed, irritated or angry with a 5 &#8211; 15 minute wait time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Long Hold Times Are Driving Consumers to Consider Other Options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that consumers are becoming more aware of alternatives to poor customer service and long hold times. Conversational voice AI &#8211; machines speaking to humans to solve customer service issues, is something that consumers are becoming more comfortable with, as 71% of people would rather speak to a machine than endure 15 minutes on hold. But, while avoiding long hold times is the primary interest in speaking with a conversational AI solution, it\u2019s not the only benefit:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t have to wait on hold<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faster resolution to my problems<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid being transferred to multiple agents<\/span><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><b>Leveraging AI for Multiple Customer Service Scenarios.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of consumers are willing to talk with a conversational machine instead of a real person when making typical customer service requests like scheduling an appointment, starting or stopping a service, or making a reservation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, 28% of American consumers have no hesitancy around talking with an automated system instead of a real person when making a customer service request.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic has changed so many things for businesses. For customer service, it created an almost impossible convergence of call volume spikes, not enough agents, and high turnover. Because of this, machine based AI solutions are now viewed by most as opportunities to help consumers more quickly while taking some of the load off overworked agents, and over-stressed contact center leaders. Despite the challenges we\u2019ve faced, the future looks bright for contact center leaders with the right technology applied.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Written by Peter Isaacson, Chief Marketing Officer at Replicant The Effects of Bad Customer Service&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":1536,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
