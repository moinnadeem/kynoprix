Managing a contact center effectively can be a significant challenge for businesses today. The customer experience is the most important thing to a successful company. The service customers get is a big influence on their experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As customer expectations are getting higher every moment, Conversational AI and machine learning are ways that companies can meet those rising expectations. Using technology is often much better than classic call center outsourcing solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What is call center outsourcing?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call center outsourcing is the process of hiring an outside, third-party company to either answer or place customer service calls. Such vendors are often located offshore to reduce costs and frequently serve multiple businesses. Many offer services in several languages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of conversational AI for call centers?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI offers elasticity, which allows businesses to automatically scale usage up or down as needed on a day-to-day basis. Organizations no longer need to pay for services they don\u2019t require all the time, resulting in a cost-effective way to manage a contact center. This digital chatbot workforce can be trained once with no turnover concerns. See how <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/products\/replicant-voice\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant Voice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> works.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Five Ways<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the top five ways that conversational AI works better than call center outsourcing:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Elastic Customer Service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Conversational AI allows customer service capacity to automatically scale up and down with demand, meeting needs during peak times while not overcharging during slower periods. Organizations are essentially only paying for what they require, no more and no less.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Faster, Better Resolutions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By reducing the average handle time of each call, first-contact resolution is improved, providing an improved customer experience that feels more natural and human-like. This means that basic questions and requests are addressed immediately while machine learning technology routes more difficult questions to the right level of expertise within the organization.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lower Costs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Compared with hiring full-time agents or engaging an outsourced contact center, conversational AI is much less expensive. Once the system is established, it can continue to \u201clearn\u201d from questions and responses, improving its performance over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Multi-Language Service<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With the global nature of today\u2019s market, businesses will want an easy way to add customer service in multiple languages. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.openaccessbpo.com\/blog\/top-5-customer-service-languages-every-brand-needs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows there are five key languages that are most often used around the globe including English, Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic, and French. Diversity in language is more easily offered by technology vs. call center outsourcing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>More Control<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The average call center has human <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustradius.com\/vendor-blog\/call-center-statistics-trends\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turnover rates at 30 percent and 45 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the highest of any industry.
