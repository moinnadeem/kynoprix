By most counts, we have now experienced four significant spikes in cases since March 2020.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With increasingly contagious variants, and changing safety protocols, more contact center agents are yet again unavailable for work. This, of course, has increased pressure on contact centers already battling staffing shortages, inconsistencies with outsourcing partners, and unpredictable call volume spikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While nearly every industry has been impacted, led by travel, hospitality, and healthcare, the ripple effect for contact centers in particular has been in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/local\/washington-dc\/2022\/01\/11\/covid-surge-upends-public-services-dc-area\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their ability to serve customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent months have made it clear: workforces and staffing fluctuations aren\u2019t going anywhere.

If you\u2019re leading a team, it\u2019s important to view your employees as a reflection of your brand. Customers calling brands with greater support resources regularly use that to inform their total spend with a business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review\u2019s list of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/08\/8-ways-managers-can-support-employees-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee support strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> include training and upskilling.

Unfortunately, call volumes in most industries are not just impossible to forecast, but rising by the month.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers experiencing difficulties with under- or over-staffing are great fits for conversational AI.

Conversational AI can also completely replace your IVR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The offloading of routine calls and repetitive back-office work is one of the leading reasons agents love Replicant as much as customers.
