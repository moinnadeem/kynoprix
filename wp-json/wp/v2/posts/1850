As more and more companies prioritize the customer experience, expectations for service have skyrocketed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, according to a January 2022 article on Forbes.com, three-fourths of customers indicated that \u201cthey expected a response within 5 minutes.\u201d The article goes on to point out that as more people become accustomed to living life online, their expectations for customer service increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, companies are turning to customer service solutions that include conversational AI. This allows the organization to automate those repetitive, mundane tasks that can be time-consuming as well as soul-crushing for live agents. Customers get a better experience and customer service representatives can focus their work on more engaging and\/or challenging situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What technologies can improve the customer experience?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/thinking-machine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking Machine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a simple AI customer service technology that can improve the call center experience through contact center automation. Every channel of the customer experience is improved by providing AI-powered, no-wait resolutions to common requests. When customers call, text, or send a message, they get their problems resolved and get answers quickly and efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What makes a good call center experience?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every call center experience should make customers feel heard, answer inquiries, and provide solutions. A good experience is one that is also fast and efficient.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumers have also come to expect personalization. This should be provided in all channels, offering immediate resolution or answers. There should be no need for a person to repeat basic information upon inquiry escalation. Technology can easily facilitate this experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How difficult is AI technology to implement in a call center?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using AI for customer service means a relatively simple implementation. For example, Replicant\u2019s solution seamlessly integrates with popular SaaS and e-commerce platforms, CRMs, and other technologies including custom-built proprietary platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can AI really transform the customer experience?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is transforming the call center experience in a wide range of industries. For example, if a customer calls to make a hotel reservation, it could find a room, schedule the dates, and text a reservation confirmation in a matter of seconds. AI tools can also provide answers to frequently asked questions, personalize experiences based on past purchases or actions, and provide more than a 50 percent reduction in average handle time (AHT) compared to live agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s solution vs. others<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our solution does not displace existing contact centers, software, or human agents. Rather, it complements live representatives by managing repetitive and mundane work, allowing human agents to respond to requests that require more empathy and creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thinking Machine effectively collects knowledge from every customer conversation. By combining AI and customer experience, the central neural network becomes \u201csmarter\u201d over time so that customer conversations improve without deploying new scripts. In addition, Replicant\u2019s experts regularly optimize and test new scripts as well as call flows, which means little effort for your IT team for continuous improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are ready to upgrade the call center experience at your company, learn more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-conversational-ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conversational AI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now.
