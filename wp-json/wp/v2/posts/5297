Customer service horror stories are often widely shared online, covered in the news, or experienced firsthand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the survey isn\u2019t merely an observation. It\u2019s a result. As many industries are still in recovery mode after being upended by the pandemic, customer service and hospitality at large are declining in the eyes of many Americans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact center leaders, the data shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indictment of their performance, but an opportunity to reassess their priorities around today\u2019s customer perceptions. Here are the biggest takeaways:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Points of failure outside of the contact center increase demand<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">74% of Americans reported having a product or service problem in the past year. The incidence of customer-reported problems has more than doubled since 1976. In the last few years, that trend has accelerated. Though the effects of product and service shortcomings are far from contact centers\u2019 fault, the impact hits them the hardest.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Labor shortages outside of the contact center, for example, can cause a massive spike in airline call volumes when flights are canceled due to staffing issues. Similarly, supply chain delays can lead to thousands of order status checks and cancellations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat it\u2019s creating is even more of a rift, is what the data would suggest, between companies and their customers,\u201d said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/nexstar_media_wire\/3894570-national-customer-rage-survey-points-to-troubling-trend-among-us-consumers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott M. Broetzmann<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the President and CEO of Customer Care Measurement &amp; Consulting. \u201cWhat we have here is a failure to communicate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When irregular scenarios happen, communication becomes even more important. As long as unpredictable service disruptions exist, contact centers must become more efficient at automating their most common, spike-prone call drivers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach can include the rapid deployment of outbound messages, quickly customizing automated scripts, and reallocating agents to help customers understand how you\u2019re prioritizing their requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agent well-being must be priority number one\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43% of customers yelled or raised their voice to express displeasure, an 8% increase in aggressive customer behavior in just eight years. While this is an obvious red flag for brands, more importantly it\u2019s a problem for the agents that have to deal with the rage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a time when hiring and retaining agents has never been more challenging, contact centers must place an emphasis on improving the agent experience. One strategy for accomplishing this is a focus on quality over quantity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agents want to help customers solve real problems. Enabling them to spend more time on nuanced issues and less on a high volume of repetitive questions is a great place to start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe need to change the social contract and not think of these employees as \u2018low skill workers,\u2019\u201d said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2023\/03\/15\/1163723617\/customer-service-satisfaction-survey-freakout-shortage-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amas Tenumah<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, author of Waiting for Service: An Insider&#8217;s Account of Why Customer Service is Broken and Tips to Avoid Bad Service. \u201cThese are complicated requests, because if they were easy, a bot or a machine could do it. And the quicker we evolve as an industry, the better off we will be,&#8221; he said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That sentiment is well reflected by agents themselves. When contact centers deploy a cutting-edge AI platform like Contact Center Automation, employees don\u2019t fear for their jobs. After years of being given tools that encourage them to answer more calls faster, automation is a welcome solution for finally offloading their most mundane tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor technology frustrates more than it optimizes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To meet the expectations of today\u2019s customers, contact centers need to revamp their automation strategies. With natural AI conversations becoming <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/what-chatgpt-means-and-does-not-mean-for-contact-centers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mainstream thanks to releases like ChatGPT<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s no longer enough to offer a low-intelligence chatbot or rigid IVR. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers are more willing than ever to speak to a machine, as long as that machine meets today\u2019s AI standards. When those standards aren\u2019t met, customers not only notice, their satisfaction plummets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou start this interaction and you&#8217;re met with an automated system \u2014 press one, press two \u2014 or a machine you&#8217;re trying to communicate with,\u201d said Tenumah. \u201cThey can&#8217;t understand you, or you&#8217;re met with a chatbot on the website, and then you get past that and then you give them your information. And then you finally get to a human, and the human asks you to repeat your information.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comprehensive automation solution no longer should exist in a silo, focusing only on containment and deflection. Instead, it should be integrated into every part of a contact center\u2019s tech stack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the customer, this means natural conversations, omnichannel experiences, fully automated resolutions, and intelligent escalations that don\u2019t force them to repeat information when they\u2019re passed off to an agent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-sygm4yjbdvwv7fdbgulz-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent survey found that Americans are not just increasingly dissatisfied with customer service, they\u2019re&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":5298,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The National Customer Rage Survey: 3 Takeaways - Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"American customers are becoming angrier than ever.
