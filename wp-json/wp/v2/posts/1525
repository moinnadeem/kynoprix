Important questions to ask often start with their own employees.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will a solution save time and empower as many team members as possible \u2013\u00a0not just management? How will decision-makers track value? And, ultimately, how will a given solution\u2019s value be tracked?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurers must be diligent and utilize tools like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/roi-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROI calculators<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make decisions while ensuring a given solution comes with easy-to-use dashboards that give agents and leaders real-time insights.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Building vs. buying vs. partnering<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As digital transformation becomes ubiquitous throughout the insurance industry, it\u2019s more common for businesses to ask what solutions they can build themselves.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, with a growing market of purchasable technology, decision-makers are more often looking for reliable expertise to come with any given solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important questions to ask when exploring each avenue include whether your organization has the resources not only to build a solution, but the time and dedicated know-how to manage it long-term.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When buying a solution, make sure you\u2019re getting a partner versus a vendor \u2013\u00a0a team dedicated to your customers, your ROI, and a relationship built on trust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Solutions must land and expand<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many technologies in the market, it\u2019s paramount that insurers don\u2019t simply buy off the shelf year after year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solutions must get better with age \u2013 not depreciate the second they reach production. This is especially important in AI solutions, a field that is improving at a rapid pace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cContinuous learning in conversational AI means an entire ecosystem of learning,\u201d said Replicant CTO and co-founder Benjamin Gleitzman at our ITC demo.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA solution that automatically improves its ability to understand customers with every interaction, but also has the agility to be regularly improved as a technology to stay ahead of the innovation curve.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Security is non-negotiable<\/h2>\n<p><b>\u201c<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world becomes increasingly connected, people will face a growing host of threats from a range of sources,\u201d Chris Krebs, former director of the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said during his talk Tuesday.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs connectivity increases, so will threat actors \u2014 state actors, criminals and everyone in between.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is non-negotiable that insurers, their customers, and their solutions have full confidence that services are secure and their information protected.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This not only means operating all procedures under PCI, SOC 2, and HIPAA compliance, but partnering with solution providers that have redundancies and fail-safes to protect against infiltrations.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want Replicant\u2019s full ITC demo experience?
