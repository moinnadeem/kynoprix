Some take a gradual approach, starting by automating a single process like Routing or Customer Authentication.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others leverage automation to start offering after hours support or as an overflow option when demand spikes. Others implement around a more robust use case, like automating 100% of Appointments or Dispatch Requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In each scenario, the goal is the same: test the impact of Contact Center Automation and, eventually, realize enough value that the business case of going all-in becomes clear.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was the case for OnProcess, a supply chain business focused on equipment recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Resolve 2022 Mark Oldani, COO of OnProcess, shared why his team decided to dive head first into Contact Center Automation after understanding its benefits. Their partnership with Replicant has transformed their ability to interact with customers while adding significant value for their agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OnProcess manages the circular supply chain for companies that require moving hardware and equipment around, processing some 20 million service orders and returns a year in over 110 countries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recovery of inventory is the largest part of OnProcess\u2019 business, according to Oldani, but it\u2019s also a very straightforward job dependent on the repetition of fairly simple tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you look at the agents that we had on some of our most routine programs, those are the ones that had the highest attrition rates,\u201d said Oldani. He said the attrition rate for agents in these entry-level roles was in the 9-11% range on a monthly basis because the job \u201cwas not complex, it was super routine and redundant.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oldani explained that when OnProcess started moving their agents out of jobs with \u201croutine and mundane work\u201d and into roles with more complex responsibilities, the company saw \u201ca huge difference in their satisfaction level and their retention level.\u201d In fact, the attrition rate for employees with enhanced responsibilities dropped to 1-3% per month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attrition dipped for entry-level agents, too, down to 4-6% per month, \u201cBecause we don&#8217;t need to hire as many people at that first level,\u201d Oldani said. \u201cAnd even the ones on the first level jobs can see what we&#8217;re doing. And they can see how [automation] is benefiting them in their jobs.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Contact Center Automation didn\u2019t just <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/why-contact-center-agents-love-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help create a greater purpose for OnProcess agents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It also improved the company\u2019s capacity to resolve many common customer requests by providing automated support across a variety of channels. \u201cWe want to be available any way and every way,\u201d said Oldani.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the more complicated customer support requests that still require the expertise of a live agent, \u201cwe want them to engage with that customer with the data in hand,\u201d said Oldani. Indeed, Contact Center Automation <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/how-to-use-contact-center-data-to-improve-agents\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides agents with knowledge and information about customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps inform the response and potential resolution before the interaction even begins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oldani called the implementation and success of their Replicant partnership an \u201cabsolute home run\u201d for OnProcess \u2013 and he has the metrics to back it up:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11% improvement in equipment return rates <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAT improved by 40%<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">500% increase in outbound volume<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% reduction in average hold time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35% net monthly savings<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside these impressive figures that demonstrate the value Contact Center Automation has brought to OnProcess, Oldani also highlighted <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/myth-automation-is-bad-for-customer-service-agents-heres-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another key fact<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWe haven&#8217;t laid off anybody associated with this,\u201d he said. The changes have actually allowed the company to win new business faster by freeing up nearly 40 agents and transitioning them to help out with new clients. \u201cThe great news is people are going into new jobs, these digital services and automation jobs,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt&#8217;s a constant effort to keep building energy around a digital transformation. And going all in on automation is not a one-time thing, it&#8217;s a constant thing,\u201d said Oldani. \u201cWe don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s coming next. This world is changing quickly. Technology&#8217;s changing quickly. But if you&#8217;re all in, you&#8217;re going to be positioned to take advantage of the next wave of whatever it is when it comes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/resources\/events-webinars\/resolve-rewind\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resolve Rewind<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to access a trove of insightful presentations from contact center leaders and customer service innovators, and learn more about how Contact Center Automation is changing the way companies engage with their customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!---[CTA] Watch the on-demand session \u201cAnatomy of a Conversation\u201d from Resolve 2022 with Replicant Co-founder and CTO, Benjamin Gleitzman, and Head of Product, Meghna Suresh.---><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why OnProcess Went All-In On Automation Contact Center Automation&#8217;s ability to transform customer service operations,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":4869,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Why OnProcess Went All-In On Automation - Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"OnProcess, an equipment retrieval business, went all-in on automation with Replicant.
