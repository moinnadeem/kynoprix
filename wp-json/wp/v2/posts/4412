The problem? Appointment scheduling can get complicated fast.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, <\/span><b>they take time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From healthcare to consumer services and every industry in between, contact center agents can spend hours a day on appointment scheduling alone. On top of that, spikes can occur at any moment and are impossible to staff for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, <\/span><b>they\u2019re complex. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every appointment is as simple as picking a time. Customers may ask questions, certain appointments may require instructions and pre-qualification, and some can require long validation processes involving multiple data sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, <\/span><b>they get missed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. No-show appointments are a costly result of limited scheduling solutions. Performing appointment reminders can be a manual, time-consuming process and even automated solutions can limit customers\u2019 ability to easily modify bookings which lead to more no-shows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, <\/span><b>digital solutions fall short<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. No amount of app-based or digital schedulers can fully eliminate customers\u2019 preference for instantaneous phone service. Digital-only appointment solutions can frustrate customers and silo valuable customer data in a black box.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Replicant has made the complex simple.
