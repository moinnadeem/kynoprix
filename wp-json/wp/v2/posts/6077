They wanted to eliminate wait times and free up agents to spend more time with members. But, as their VP of Customer Service said, \u201cconversational AI hadn&#8217;t gotten to the point where I felt like it was a good member experience until we saw Replicant.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Partnership: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant partnered with this provider to identify four initial use cases that would lower costs and improve the member experience. The selected call drivers \u2013 Member Authentication, Provide Fitness ID, Determining Eligibility, and Find a Gym Location \u2013 were high in volume, prone to seasonal spikes, and repetitive, making them ideal automation candidates. Replicant designed a Thinking Machine around three goals: 1) deliver natural conversations 2) fully resolve member requests and 3) provide seamless handoffs to agents when escalations are needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur first true test was that first week of January and the Replicant Thinking Machine performed really well. Having the pre-verification step off our agents\u2019 plates gives them the ability to focus on what the member actually needs versus just checking the initial boxes.\u201d &#8211; VP of Customer Service, Leading Healthcare Provider<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>The Outcome: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant launched at the start of the calendar year, when Fitness ID requests are at their peak. Now, members can resolve these requests naturally without having to navigate a rigid IVR or wait on hold. This streamlined the member experience and significantly reduced the time agents spent on simple requests. Meanwhile, agents who received escalations no longer had to collect initial member information, which saved valuable time in their workflows. With Replicant taking calls, the provider relies less on temporary FTEs, making member experiences more consistent and workforce management more efficient.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>4.7\/5<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Member Satisfaction<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>3 Min. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avg. Time Saved in Escalations<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Up to 25% <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total Call Volume Automated<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>50 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTEs Saved During Peak Season<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Scale Symbol <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elastic Scalability During Spikes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur partnership with Replicant has been very successful in meeting our expectations and evolving the call flows with each use case. We&#8217;re learning a lot every day by listening to recordings and A\/B testing.\u201d &#8211; VP of Customer Service, Leading Healthcare Provider<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Healthcare is the most important service a customer will use in their lifetime.
