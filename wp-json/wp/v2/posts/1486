These changes will force service organizations to face multiple dilemmas around customers, strategy, organization and technology.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHowever, overcoming these dilemmas will prompt service to transform from a cost center to a relationship-oriented profit center.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world\u2019s leading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/thinking-machine\/\">Contact Center Automation<\/a> solution, Replicant has helped customers design to, and meet, the evolving needs of contact centers throughout the pandemic and ensuing great resignation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how Replicant helps contact centers navigate 10 dilemmas so they can play a larger role in owning the customer relationship and driving business growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b><\/b>1. Human and machine customers<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, your customer may not always be human. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled devices to collect data and communicate with each other. Automated outbound conversations are already performing scheduling, ordering, and dispatch tasks for customers across many industries<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the type of customer you\u2019re serving, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine is able to communicate with both humans and machines. Via chat, SMS or voice, Replicant\u2019s conversational AI acts as a universal language across humans and machines. If a device isn\u2019t able to verbally communicate with the Thinking Machine, Replicant can easily integrate with other systems through APIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When both humans and machines are customers, contact centers also need to be prepared to handle an increase in customer requests. Using AI, Replicant enables contact centers to infinitely scale their customer service capacity alongside demand. Whether you\u2019re receiving thousands or millions of calls a day, the Thinking Machine will respond to all of them immediately.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>2. Service journey and\/or life journey<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of focusing on just the customer service journey, organizations are starting to play a role in the customer\u2019s entire journey. By connecting service, sales, and marketing, companies can become a part of a customer\u2019s life. Companies that take this approach are positioned to create more revenue and customer loyalty by being there when customers need them, even after long pauses in engagement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many possibilities for how companies can leverage Contact Center Automation to engage with customers outside of the customer service interaction and make their lives easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thinking Machine doesn\u2019t just resolve inbound customer questions and issues. It can upsell and cross-sell, giving customers a personalized sales experience and enabling you to capture more of your customer\u2019s business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thinking Machine can even execute outbound conversations, giving you the ability to proactively engage and share information with customers. Lastly, Replicant automatically transcribes and tags calls to turn unstructured conversation data into actionable insights. You can now understand what customers ask about most or have the greatest number of issues with and use that to shape your product or service.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>3. Service channels and omnichannel experiences<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers expect to be able to interact with a brand across physical and digital properties. Brands should remember them, know their customer history, and continue conversations across channels. This shift in how companies think about interacting with customers will result in a consistent customer experience across all modalities and devices and higher customer satisfaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant gives you a head start with crafting an omnichannel experience. Aside from voice, you\u2019ll also be able to service your customers through SMS, chat, and other digital channels. A customer interaction that starts on the phone can end over text and be just as accurate and effective. Having these different methods of engagement enables customers to seamlessly move from one modality or device to another.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Reactive and\/or proactive service<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation enables companies to do more with the same or fewer amount of agents. By collecting and analyzing conversation data, companies can identify times when customers are likely to contact them and proactively reach out. When you\u2019re anticipating customer needs and meeting them before they contact you, companies will be able to reduce contact volume and increase customers\u2019 appreciation toward the brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant automates outbound conversations, which makes it possible for companies to proactively communicate with customers at scale. You can easily and efficiently share updates and important information. For example, telecommunications providers can let customers know when service has been restored after an outage, or a product is back in stock.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>5. Assisted service and\/or self-service<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although companies have invested in self-service, customers continue to contact companies through live channels. This could be because it\u2019s difficult to locate the self-service options, or customers find that the options in the knowledge library, for example, don\u2019t meet their unique situation. There\u2019s also still a long way for self-service channels to go in order to be truly effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMigrating contact volume from assisted to self-service channels, upgrading legacy contact center technology and automating customer service processes \u2014 all of which fall under digital channels and capabilities were rated the top three most important priorities in 2021,\u201d as surveyed by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2021-02-11-gartner-says-customer-service-and-support-leaders-pla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As companies make this transition, it\u2019s important to understand the types of interactions and customers that best fit each channel. This will help you strike a balance between these two types of channels and ensure they\u2019re used effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voice remains a primary customer service channel, with 57% of customers ranking call support as their initial channel preference. Many companies use IVRs to offer self-service over the phone. Unfortunately, IVRs create a poor customer experience and even cause companies to lose business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant provides a self-service solution that uses conversational AI as the automation engine to fully resolve \u2014 not deflect \u2014 100% of tier 1 issues without agent intervention. Unlike most automated service options, Replicant doesn\u2019t require humans to learn how to use it or to respond in \u201crobotic\u201d ways. Customers truly get resolution on their own by speaking with the Thinking Machine as they normally would a human.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>6. Service cost center and\/or relationship profit center<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to gain a competitive advantage as well as benefit businesses more, contact centers are starting to move from being a cost center to a profit center. With more customers moving to digital and self-service channels, customer growth and retention can increasingly be driven by customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/gartner-top-10-strategic-predictions-for-2021-and-beyond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> anticipates that, \u201cBy 2025, 40% of customer service organizations will become profit centers by becoming de facto leaders in digital customer engagement.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting products, services, and upgrades no longer relies on a live agent. Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine can intelligently suggest related products and add-ons to customers. If customers aren\u2019t interested, they can easily decline. But if customers are interested, you\u2019ve just earned more revenue without lifting a finger.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>7. Service department and customer teams<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more routine and transactional tasks are automated, agents are afforded more opportunities to level up their skills and expertise to execute more complicated tasks. To achieve this, customer service organizations need to restructure their teams for even greater efficiency. You\u2019ll need to bring together cross-functional teams that work on customer well-being across different segments, like industry or product type.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can accelerate your move toward all-encompassing customer teams by automating high-volume, repetitive customer conversations with Replicant. It takes just a few weeks to implement Replicant start automating tier 1 requests across every channel with the Thinking Machine.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>8. Work from anywhere and distributed workforces<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic forced companies to challenge the contact center model. Companies realized the benefits of remote work and proved customer service could still run smoothly without a physical office. Knowing contact centers no longer rely on agents coming into a physical office, customer service leaders need to consider whether they want to continue with a 100% work from anywhere model, a 100% contact center model, or a hybrid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s been proven that contact centers can successfully operate without a brick-and-mortar location, relying entirely on human agents still leaves contact centers susceptible to not having enough agent capacity. Agents might call out sick or quit suddenly, and there will always be unanticipated spikes in call volume.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contact centers use both Replicant and live agents, they can flexibly adjust customer service capacity as demand increases or decreases. With the Thinking Machine acting as the first line of defense for all inbound requests, customers won\u2019t experience a wait time \u2014 even when you don\u2019t have enough agents or experience a surge in customer issues. Plus, harnessing the power of humans and AI enables contact centers to scale more efficiently and at lower costs.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>9. Employee and\/or freelance\/flex<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s more channels than ever for customers to receive help and find information. As more customers choose to self-assist, they\u2019re turning to independent experts and channels. For example, customers might go to Google or YouTube first to get help, instead of your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/gartner-top-10-strategic-predictions-for-2021-and-beyond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> predicts that, \u201cBy 2025, customers will pay a freelance customer service expert to resolve 75% of their customer service issues.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more customers seek out help from independent experts and channels, you\u2019ll receive fewer customer service inquiries. However, companies lose a customer touchpoint and control over their brand and customer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more employees wanting flexibility with when and where they work, companies also have to consider if and how they\u2019ll support this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/why-contact-center-agents-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-replicant\/\">best of both worlds<\/a> when leveraging Contact Center Automation. They can maintain control over the customer experience while decreasing the amount of inquiries agents have to handle. As more people use self-service to get help, you can ensure customers get the correct information about your products and accurate troubleshooting by deploying a Thinking Machine custom-built for your brand that can be activated through any channel.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>10. Best-in-class customer service suite<b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer service organizations have been using disparate systems for years. This has created disjointed customer experiences, inconsistent data, and integration issues. Gartner recommends shifting to a suite of composable applications to create an integrated and personalized customer experience. Composable applications also enable organizations to quickly adapt and innovate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant is the leader in Contact Center Automation, powering millions of fast, natural, and contextual customer conversations each month for some of the world\u2019s most trusted brands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you get the best automation solution with Replicant, you also achieve a horizontal solution that integrates with any CCaaS platform, CRM, and custom internal systems to access and update data. This ensures you\u2019ll create a seamless customer experience across voice and other channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep up with rapidly changing customer behaviors, it\u2019s imperative that contact centers overcome these 10 challenges. It\u2019s precisely why Replicant was created. By incorporating Replicant into your customer service strategy, you\u2019ll set up your contact center to succeed well into the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn more about Replicant\u2019s Contact Center Automation solution and how it can fit into your roadmap and start returning value sooner than you think.  <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/the-great-resignation-why-your-contact-center-wont-survive-without-automation-2\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7198\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheGreatResignation_2501x469-2-1024x192.png\" alt=\"Download The Great Resignation: Why Your Contact Center Won't Survive Without Automation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contact Center Automation Is Built for Today\u2019s Challenges As customer service and support organizations look&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":10,"featured_media":1488,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>10 Challenges Contact Centers Can Navigate With Automation | Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Gartner identified 10 dilemmas customer service will face in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
