And you\u2019ve taken into account that 91% of consumers say they have experienced poor customer service in the past 6 months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, as contact center leaders set their sights on 2022, the new challenge will be adopting the right qualities to make contact centers amenable to the shortcomings of the previous year to remain adaptable and scalable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that the modern customer is here to stay, as are the changes created by this year\u2019s events, here are some of the most important qualities contact centers should adopt for success in 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Scalable Capacity<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workforce management challenges of 2021 have made one thing clear: predicting staffing needs and hiring cycles is not only an arduous process, but a virtually impossible task, especially as it relates to hiring agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, it\u2019s not just because there aren\u2019t enough talented agents available to hire \u2013 Fortune reports the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d has the economy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2021\/10\/21\/the-great-resignation-is-no-joke\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">down 5 million employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from pre-crisis levels \u2013 but at the rate most contact centers need to scale, it\u2019s simply unrealistic to expect hiring cycles to align with unpredictable customer demand and seasonality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) remains a suitable option, truly scalable capacity gives call centers the ability to respond at a moment\u2019s notice to even the most unpredictable spikes in call volumes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers should have\u00a0 flexible capacity that is infinitely scalable and only costs money when it&#8217;s being used to support their customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI is one solution, and is akin to having thousands of your best agents on call at any moment. It eliminates hold times, completely resolves tier-1 issues, and often <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increases<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> CSAT when compared to IVRs and live support.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI not only prepares contact centers for volume increases, it prevents overstaffing, which quickly leads to cost overruns, especially in relation to BPOs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Unlimited Empathy<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to \u201c10 New Call Center Trends &amp; Predictions for 2021\/2022\u201d, published by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-trends\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the pandemic has created 68% more call escalations, 50% more difficult calls and 34% longer hold times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been a year of frustration for customers as hiring shortages caused hold times to skyrocket and supply chain challenges created shipping and ordering chaos. How should contact centers respond?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, with empathy and understanding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most customers understand that this year\u2019s challenges have been out of most businesses\u2019 control. But to truly empathize with the customer experience,\u00a0 live agents should be focused completely on issues only humans can properly understand so that customers get the empathetic support they need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI personalizes customer interactions to resolve routine, high-volume requests at unprecedented speeds, which frees up live agents to handle high-empathy issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This symbiosis between conversational AI and agents means customers get the right level of service for their issue, and agents aren\u2019t bogged down with repetitive requests.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result? Higher retention rates and satisfaction among both customers and agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/overcome-the-contact-center-crisis-with-conversational-ai\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6099\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/VoiceAItoOvercomeCC_2501x469-300x56.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Around-the-clock Availability<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s customers are busy. Part of their changing expectations is that they can receive assistance whenever and wherever they need it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The phrase \u201cthe best ability is availability\u201d should be a leading mantra for any contact center in 2022. An automation solution with 24\/7, 365 capacity means your contact center is always open so customers can get answers at their convenience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a solution like conversational AI, customers can place orders, retrieve account documents, register a new product, start a return \u2013\u00a0the list goes on and on \u2013 at any time of the day or week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on their schedules, customers can also schedule a call-back and conversational AI can execute outbound calls to reach them when it\u2019s most convenient.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delighting your customers doesn\u2019t have a timestamp, and maximum availability ensures that every time a customer contacts support, they\u2019ll leave with a resolution, not frustrated by inconvenient hold times or unreachable agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Deep Customer Insights<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2022, no customer conversation should go un-analyzed. Contact centers should not just be able to resolve customer issues, but also provide insights into their customer interactions to serve customers better every time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the world of conversational AI, this means your customer conversations are no longer a black box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact center leaders get visibility into all customer support conversations. Through a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/dashboard\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">single, user-friendly dashboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, contact center managers can monitor conversations, analyze insights from conversation data, receive recommendations for improvements, and take action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important insights contact centers should track in 2022 include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why customers contact support<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer sentiment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most successful conversations with A\/B testing\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call dispositions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And other KPIS like call volume, average handle time, and customer satisfaction<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Downstream Visibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other side of the analytics coin is that conversation data is only as good as your ability to take action from it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers need the ability to not just draw concrete conclusions, but <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">see<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how they can address their gaps and opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From conversation insights, contact centers must have the flexibility to take action immediately by updating conversation scripts to create the optimal customer experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center leaders should also have the ability to create new automation flows when trends reveal increases in unsupported customer requests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers have long lacked the kind of self-service needed to scale their automation solutions without manual analytics and laborious technical projects.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, conversational AI solutions have evolved to the point where every contact center should have instant control and visibility over their conversations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/overcome-the-contact-center-crisis-with-conversational-ai\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6099\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/VoiceAItoOvercomeCC_2501x469-300x56.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1334\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><center><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By now, you\u2019ve probably adjusted your contact center strategy and formed new working habits after&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":1576,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Must-Have Qualities for Every Contact Center in 2022 | Replicant<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The modern customer is here to stay;
