Using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/what-is-conversational-ai-and-how-does-it-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conversational AI<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/natural-language-processing-and-the-future-of-voice-in-tech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">natural language processing<\/a>, machine learning, and big data, Contact Center Automation enables machines and humans to converse in a human-like way, while relieving agents of monotonous tasks that have contributed to growing attrition rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of Contact Center Automation are experienced more and more every day as customers engage with effective machines that offer far better experiences than the Interactive Voice Responders (IVRs) of the early 2000s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact centers, automation is changing the game when it comes to providing faster, more accurate, and more scalable service without having to add agents or contract with a business process outsourcing (BPO) provider. Contact Center Automation reduces total customer service costs while giving customers easy, fast, 24\/7 access to customer service without having to wait on hold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a contact center looking at adding Contact Center Automation to your roadmap, here\u2019s a look at seven of the top benefits you can expect:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved customer experience<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automated scalability<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduced costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">24\/7 accessibility<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved First Contact Resolution<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased agent engagement and productivity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More powerful data\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Improved customer experience<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most significant benefit of Contact Center Automation is improved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/conversational-ai-brings-new-experiences-to-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer experience<\/a> \u2014 a core goal of every contact center.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more brands are losing customers by simply making them wait. Almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arise.com\/resources\/blog\/arise-customer-service-frustration-series-phone-hold-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">two-thirds<\/a> of surveyed consumers are only willing to wait two minutes or less before hanging up. By deploying Contact Center Automation, contact centers reduce or eliminate wait times. This creates an immediate uptick in how fast customers receive service and delivers an easy, convenient option to solve their issue without having to rely on agent availability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For complex issues, Contact Center Automation can transfer customers to an agent \u2014 serving up a complete transcript of the conversation to the agent, so customers don\u2019t need to repeat themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although we\u2019ve gotten used to speaking in keywords or selecting from a limited menu when interacting with self-service options, it\u2019s not a great experience. Just think of the last time you interacted with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/conversational-ai-vs-ivr-whats-the-difference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IVR<\/a>. Contact Center Automation enables customers to talk or write in natural language, rather than feel like they\u2019re \u201ctalking to a robot.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation also integrates with any CRM, allowing it to deliver a more personalized experience from the moment it responds to the customer. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/blog\/announcing-the-state-of-personalization-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">over 60%<\/a> of consumers saying they\u2019ll likely become repeat buyers after a personalized shopping experience, personalization can help contact centers turn into revenue generators.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Automated scalability<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation gives leaders an unlimited capacity, which adds the ability to scale customer service up or down based on customer demand. This reduces contact centers\u2019 need to add staff, increase shifts, or outsource \u2014 all expensive or slow ways of scaling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation responds to every customer immediately, no matter how many customer requests there are. Contact centers are afforded the ability to handle both anticipated and unpredictable spikes in customer demand. This elasticity is central to the modern contact center\u2019s ability to respond in an unpredictable world and is a key component to business continuity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Reduced costs<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key benefit that contact centers get from Contact Center Automation is the ability to serve more customers than ever, while also lowering costs \u2014 an unprecedented opportunity in the customer service industry. Most Contact Center Automation solutions cost significantly less than outsourcing or adding staff. In fact, Contact Center Automation can cost just 45% of a highly optimized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/replicant-ai-call-center-outsourcing-and-bpo-pros-and-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BPO provider<\/a>. Additionally, you only pay for the service you use. When request volumes are slow, you don\u2019t have to pay employee wages or BPO fees for unused agent capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation also has minimal training costs. And if you choose a Contact Center Automation provider that continuously improves its AI, you\u2019ll be assured that your solution will evolve as the field of AI does too \u2014 further extending your ROI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>24\/7 accessibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers want to be able to contact brands when and where they choose, but staffing agents 24\/7 is expensive. Contact Center Automation enables you to offer around-the-clock service globally, without needing to expand shifts or staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Contact Center Automation is capable of resolving over 90% of tier 1 issues (repetitive, common requests like \u201cwhere is my order?\u201d), it reduces the amount of issues that require an agent call-back. With Contact Center Automation, customers are able to resolve issues immediately over any channel and in any language, no matter what time of day or night the need arises.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Improved First Contact Resolution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Contact Resolution (FCR) is a key metric that\u2019s used to determine how well businesses are meeting customer needs. Many contact centers use FCR as their primary performance indicator or track it as part of their customer experience metrics, and they\u2019re constantly trying to improve their FCR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers want their issues resolved in as few interactions as possible. If you can resolve a customer\u2019s issue the first time they contact you, they\u2019re more likely to feel positive about the experience. Contact Center Automation can increase your FCR since it fully resolves common issues and doesn\u2019t deflect customers to an agent or another service channel like FAQ pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Increased agent engagement and productivity<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agents often handle the same call type hundreds of times per shift. Routine, transactional issues take up the majority of their time and, frankly, zap their enthusiasm for the job. In fact, repetitive work is one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nojitter.com\/customer-experience\/augmenting-your-contact-center-next-gen-cx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">top three reasons<\/a> for agent attrition. Contact Center Automation frees agents from the routine work and gives them more time to draw on their empathy, creativity, and problem-solving skills to address more complex issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, contact centers can refocus and retrain agents to perform higher-value activities. This includes upselling, cross-selling, and performing high-touch outbound proactive service, such as calling customers about late payments or notifying them of special discounts. Repositioning agents to perform higher value work can make their jobs more fulfilling, open them to better development opportunities, and improve retention.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More accurate data collection<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation can capture data more accurately and comprehensively than humans. By automatically tagging conversations and transcribing every word of voice and text conversations, Contact Center Automation unlocks an incredible amount of customer data and insights. Companies can use this data to identify trends and run targeted campaigns. Better data collection also translates to better customer experiences, as Contact Center Automation gives businesses the power to understand customer interactions in a deeper way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of Contact Center Automation build a strong business case for why companies are rapidly adopting the solution in some capacity. The unique improvements in customer experience, first contact resolution, cost savings, and scalability can only be realized by adding Contact Center Automation to your contact center\u2019s toolkit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Try Replicant<\/h2>\n<p>If you are ready to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/contact-center-automation\/request-a-demo\/\">automate your call center<\/a>, reach out to Replicant today.
