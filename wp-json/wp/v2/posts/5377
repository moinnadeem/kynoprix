But for transportation contact centers, reliable service is especially critical.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers depend on punctual rides and easy-to-reach assistance to get where they\u2019re going on time. When interruptions in service happen, customers need fast access to status updates, weather reports and ETAs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if customer service agents are asked to handle repetitive, high volume call types, phone lines get clogged quickly, making it harder for customers to schedule, cancel, and modify rides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while transportation companies are dealing with many of the same challenges as every industry \u2013 rising customer demand, economic uncertainty, and labor shortages \u2013 they also face a unique set of obstacles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From public agencies like statewide mass transit to private organizations like taxi, bus and train services, factors like seasonality, outages, and compliance must be accounted for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As customer satisfaction continues to be priority number one, passengers and transportation contact centers need an answer fast. With Contact Center Automation, not only can a solution be deployed in a matter of weeks, it\u2019s already making an impact at some of the world\u2019s largest transit agencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Challenge<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Budgets and Economic Uncertainty\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transit agencies went through some of their hardest years during the pandemic, when ridership hit record lows and caused revenues to plummet. This has forced many organizations to increase fares while cutting the amount of routes offered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe largest systems are very pressured at their lookahead on their budgets,\u201d said the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/us-57760.app.gong.io\/call?id=8774608950847219059&amp;highlights=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22SHARE%22%2C%22from%22%3A678%2C%22to%22%3A687%7D%5D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President of the American Public Transportation Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Now, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/resources\/guides\/2023-benchmark-economic-uncertainty-contact-centers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">economic headwinds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> driving further uncertainty, contact centers must find new ways to cut costs while increasing efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Staffing and Retention\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pandemic, hiring agents has become more competitive than ever. Job candidates want higher wages, better benefits, and stipends to support a work from home environment. In addition, the strict training and compliance requirements associated with onboarding a transportation agent lead to higher costs than other industries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the tightened budgets seen across transit agencies, these expectations are often impossible to meet and sustain. Similarly, outsourcing customer service to BPOs has become expensive and ineffective in improving SLAs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Call Spikes and Wait Times <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commuter ridership is experiencing a steep rebound as more employees return to offices. This has proven to be a major challenge for contact centers, who already experience seasonality from the spring to fall months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, riders who call in for support are experiencing longer wait times; they\u2019re also abandoning calls at a higher clip than ever. On the whole, call spikes caused by both predictable and unpredictable events are impossible to staff for and only further harm customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Compliance <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transit agencies face unique regulation hurdles that make reliable service not only a priority, but mission critical. Agencies that offer paratransit service for disabled patrons, for example, must adhere to SLAs set by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to meet these expectations can lead to violations, legal repercussions and monetary fines. With stakeholders that can include agency boards and elected officials, a transit contact center\u2019s Average Speed to Answer can have political and PR ramifications, in addition to the direct business impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Automation Keeps Riders Moving<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re a public transit agency or a private taxi, bus or train service, Contact Center Automation can elevate the customer experience while adding guaranteed efficiency gains that drive cost savings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation is not your standard IVR experience. Customers can speak naturally, receive SMS updates, and ask any amount of questions to receive end-to-end resolution, not just routing or FAQ information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an industry that has long relied on legacy technology to deflect and contain callers, a modern experience makes self-service more intuitive for customers\u2019 most common requests. When these call types are fully automated, agents are spared from answering thousands of simple calls every week.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common automation candidates for transportation companies include:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Trip Management:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rider authentication &amp; call routing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ride status<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Same-day travel problems<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Book a trip<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confirm a trip<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancel a trip<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reschedule a trip<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabin &amp; Seat Upgrades<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-Travel Reminders<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trip status notifications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQs:\u00a0 Confirm Fares, Bags, Boarding<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Rider Management<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage Subscription Service<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage Rewards\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check Card Balance\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase Card<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lost &amp; Found FAQ<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQs: Replacing a lost card, balance questions<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Accelerated Value for Contact Centers\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant plugs into contact centers\u2019 existing tech stack to help resolve common rider requests that don\u2019t require a live agent. Starting with rider authentication and routing, Replicant handles fare confirmations, ride status checks, new bookings, booking confirmations, modifications, cancellations and reschedules.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With zero wait times and quick resolutions, customers get what they need over any channel and agents are given the context they need to resolve high value calls. The result is increased containment rates, high customer satisfaction, eliminated call wait times and decreased abandonment rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-sygm4yjbdvwv7fdbgulz-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hold times are a challenge in every industry.
