Many industries have been navigating uncertain economic conditions for several years now, driven by seismic shifts in consumer and employment activity arising from the pandemic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, many of the issues we\u2019re seeing today started well before the lockdowns. Government attempts to keep people and businesses afloat during 2020-2021 masked these warning signs, contributing to the sense that things may get worse before they get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Replicant, we\u2019ve been exploring the impact of this anticipated economic downturn on customer service and have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-us-is-in-a-recession-heres-what-contact-centers-need-to-know\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">produced a variety of helpful resources<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for contact center leaders to consider when analyzing the challenges \u2013 and more importantly, the opportunities \u2013 that lie ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experienced customer service professionals understand the importance of investing in technology that enhances productivity, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-contact-center-automation-reduces-costs-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduces costs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and promotes customer loyalty. And this priority isn\u2019t slowing down as you\u2019d expect in a recession. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending on enterprise software is actually expected to continue to grow as leaders identify crucial \u201cmust-have\u201d pieces of technology that can both cut expenses and improve the customer experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2022-04-06-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-reach-4-point-four-trillion-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">analysis from Gartner<\/span><\/a>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projected global software spending to hit nearly $675 billion in 2022 \u2013\u00a0up 9.8% from a year earlier. This momentum is expected to continue and surge another 11.8% in 2023 to almost $755 billion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCIOs are accelerating IT investments as they recognize the importance of flexibility and agility in responding to disruption,\u201d said John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner. Clearly, there is a massive opportunity here. As the Gartner research indicates, tools that directly contribute to productivity will be prized by innovative IT professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of increased IT spending amid changing economic dynamics, automation has rapidly become <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-call-center-automation-software-works\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a critical resource for contact centers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and will continue to gain prominence as leaders look to improve customer satisfaction, backfill missing agents and reduce costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2022\/07\/20\/the-brave-new-world-of-contact-center-automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote in Forbes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how customer service is in a state of crisis, driven by an outdated model for contact centers relying on human agents forced to do repetitive, monotonous work. It is impossible to predict the number of agents necessary at any given hour, leading to understaffed operations \u2013 and furious customers. A highly scalable service, contact center automation removes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-great-resignation-remote-call-center-solutions-in-2022-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the staffing headaches<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we\u2019re seeing across so many industries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But contact center automation <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/will-ai-replace-contact-center-agents\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">isn\u2019t about replacing the role of human agents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s about automating the tedious aspects of the job that become tiresome and lead to such a high level of turnover. And don\u2019t take my word for it: a large utilities company in the midwest told us that they\u2019ve seen up to 20% agent attrition a month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A transportation company is still unable to hire enough agents just to get back to pre-pandemic numbers, which is about 30% short of its target. In a hybrid model, agents are instead empowered to work with customers who have more nuanced and complex requests, improving the quality of their job by giving them meaningful work, and providing customers with a more engaged support system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does this mean for customer service and contact center leaders like yourself? We\u2019re seeing the impact of increasing investments in \u201cmust-have\u201d technologies firsthand with Replicant customers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of our longtime clients, the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), adopted <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/call-center-automation-why-choose-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our contact center automation platform<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be \u201cprepared for whatever may come,\u201d according to Steve Bennett, supervisor of member care for CAA. \u201cWhether it\u2019s an economic downturn or a spike in call volume tomorrow, we will be able to answer calls because of the automation we already have in place.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While automation can\u2019t solve all problems, it can help businesses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-call-center-automation-software-works\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spend less time and resources resolving mundane issues<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This allows agents to focus on more complex and rewarding customer interactions, as well as increases the quality of customer service \u2013 therefore reducing customer churn and ensuring satisfaction with a brand.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The late-summer news that the U.S. had likely entered a recession didn&#8217;t come as a&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":4277,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
