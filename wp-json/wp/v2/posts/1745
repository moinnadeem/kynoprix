Many who would once have been prospective employees now don\u2019t want boring, monotonous and repetitive jobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The labor pool is shrinking, taking even more of a toll on organizations and their customer support. This has caused new, unforeseen and unplanned workforce management issues and made retention that much harder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/04\/business\/economy\/job-openings-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. Labor Department<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, more than 4.5 million people voluntarily left their jobs in November of last year. That was up from 4.2 million in October and was the most in the two decades that the government has been keeping track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Global Pandemic<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic is upending every aspect of business. It has taxed organizations greatly, leading to agent shortages, higher stress for employees who are still working, and unhappy customers (which negatively impacts customer loyalty). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-trends\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the pandemic has created 68% more call escalations, 50% more difficult calls and 34% longer hold times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Unpredictable External Forces<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, catastrophic weather events, cybersecurity threats, supply chain disruptions and other unpredictable crises are creating massive customer service challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies can\u2019t scale up and down quickly enough to meet customer demand in the face of these events.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer do the operations models of the past predict future forecasting needs as it relates to hiring and surges in customer service volumes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each passing storm, service outage, and supply chain disruption, contact centers are experiencing heightened call volumes and customers are becoming more on-edge about the status of their services and security of their information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/the-great-resignation-why-your-contact-center-wont-survive-without-automation-2\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7198\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/TheGreatResignation_2501x469-2-1024x192.png\" alt=\"Download The Great Resignation: Why Your Contact Center Won't Survive Without Automation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why BPOs aren&#8217;t Enough\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cModern problems require modern solutions.\u201d The old adage, cliche as it may be, could not be any truer than it is for today\u2019s contact centers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WFM challenges of 2021 were unprecedented and have accelerated the need for innovation in the contact center. It\u2019s imperative that every stakeholder in your organization\u2019s customer service operation takes a step back in 2022 to reassess how they traditionally addressed WFM, and evaluate the limitations of those solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Drawbacks of seasonal or temporary hiring<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Record-setting resignation rates have increased the need for labor. But where seasonal or temporary hires would step in to fill the gaps in years past, today\u2019s unprecedented resignation rates are exposing the risks of quick hires. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The drawbacks of seasonal or temporary hiring include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying on past KPIs that no longer hold to forecast future and immediate hiring needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunk training costs from hires that have joined in the last year and attrited<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No guarantee of lower AHTs, higher CSAT scores, or lower queue times<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost overruns, sometimes paying for agents to not be online<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harm to your brand promise from lack of control and unpredictability\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cRight now, our biggest concern within the call center space \u2013 specifically on reservations \u2013 is the lack of manpower. After the Great Resignation, we hired 2,500 people since May 1st of 2021. Of those, we have already lost 1,300. So all of that work just to end up with 1,200 people. Now we are facing a need to hire an additional 2,500 people before the start of the summer. Our biggest concern right now is how to get people through the pipeline as fast as possible and make them as productive as possible as soon as they start.&#8221; &#8211; CX Managing Director, Fortune 500 Airline<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Legacy technologies can\u2019t do enough<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional technologies like agent assist, IVRs, and self-service aim to ease the burden of agents and make them more productive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They deflect callers to self-service, knowledge base resources, and FAQs. Or, they route callers to departments to cut down on agents\u2019 need to make transfers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But given the current strain on agents, and the hiring challenges in the market, squeezing every ounce of productivity from your agents is not a long term solution. In fact, it can lead to further employee burnout.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, IVRs and self-service voice and chat that doesn\u2019t fully resolve issues often does more harm than good for the customer experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can force customers to sit through rigid menus, stay on calls for minutes to hours only to be deflected elsewhere, and have to repeat themselves once transferred to an agent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">56% of consumers cite automated telephone systems as <a href=\"https:\/\/omnicus.com\/blog\/contact-center-statistics\/\">the most frustrating aspect<\/a> of poor customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>BPOs are a linear solution to a dynamic problem<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the first two solutions aren\u2019t enough, traditionally contact centers turn to third-party help. This often comes in the form of seasonal employees or Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) to solve staffing and technology gaps. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These solutions are typically the most expensive methods for adding talent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they add staff, they don\u2019t have unlimited capacities and often come with premiums once a certain number of live agents are on calls. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They require exorbitant training cycles that can take weeks to months, and they can require rigid contracts that don\u2019t take into account seasonality or agent off-time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing in a BPO environment is often not feasible and the ability to pivot when key metrics are lagging is extremely slow when compared to point-and-click AI solutions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, BPOs are experiencing resignation challenges, too, as employees flock to gig economy jobs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Automation is Succeeding<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The limits of traditional contact center WFM strategies become clearer when compared to the latest technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers need a solution that can scale up or down according to customer demand, while delivering effective customer service and keeping costs low. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to this is contact center automation, beginning with the tier-1 level of customer service interactions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas temporary employees, agent assist solutions, and BPOs can excel in performing \u201cdamage control\u201d in times of need, modern automation offers a long-term foundation that can completely transform the workforce optimization of a contact center.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center automation comes in many forms. The most comprehensive solutions leverage conversational AI which has received rapid adoption rates in contact centers due to its proven ability to solve the problems of 2022. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the primary automation solution that directly partners with humans to create a seamless experience that benefits both customers and agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#1: It directly addresses pandemic-related challenges<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI can carry out natural, lifelike conversations that resolve customer issues with zero queue times and none of the frustration included with legacy solutions like IVRs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers can use the channel of their choice, speak in the language of their choice, ask multiple questions at once, and\u00a0 never have to repeat themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since conversational AI makes automation available 24\/7 \u2013 and scales when needed based on call volumes and customer interactions \u2013 it\u2019s a cost effective way of adding a virtual staff that does the work of unlimited agents without sacrificing CSAT.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#2: It immediately eases staffing and WFM strain<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI only needs to be trained once. With out-of-the box solutions, conversational AI can be customized, integrated and deployed into contact centers in just weeks. This offers immediate relief to staffing issues and unpredictable call volumes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agents love the technology because it collaborates with human employees to automate repetitive conversations, resolve tier-1 cases, and allows agents to focus on more engaging work, while acting as a first line of defense and overflow safety net.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#3: It creates a safeguard against future unpredictability<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI provides a consistent customer experience that represents your brand the same way every time. It provides insights into unstructured caller data, which helps you easily enrich the customer experience and identify opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With deep analytics that go beyond traditional metrics, contact center leaders are able to discover new call flows to automate and find more information about their call types and call patterns. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a customer\u2019s perspective, this means they get what they need with zero wait, no matter how many calls or agents you have \u2013 in other words, it provides unlimited scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><a
