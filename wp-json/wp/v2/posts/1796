The time when leaders could rely on strategies like outsourcing, deflection-oriented IVRs, and seasonal hiring is never going to return.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And contact centers can no longer kick the can down the road.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today&#8217;s consumers have grown accustomed to meals being delivered at the touch of a finger and refunds being offered with no questions asked. They expect tremendous service from every brand they interact with and they\u2019ll quickly hit \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/now\/86-percent-consumers-leave-brand-143000913.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">unsubscribe<\/a>\u201d until they get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agents have rethought what they want out of a job and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/how-the-great-resignation-is-impacting-contact-centers-in-10-data-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shifted the hiring curve downward<\/a> as they seek more engaging work. And the customer service talent pool may never fully recover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So amid all these changes, what does the new era of customer service look like?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented Agent Experiences<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic led customer service representatives to rethink what they want out of a job. It drove a mass exodus of talent away from contact centers as they sought more engaging work and less monotony.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For agents still committed to providing excellent customer service and nurturing valuable relationships, their stress levels have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.calabrio.com\/wfo\/workforce-engagement-management\/what-agents-want-in-the-era-of-the-great-resignation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">never been higher<\/a>. To retain and support them, a new agent experience must be offered.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas agent assist solutions have long helped service reps execute their roles more efficiently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-rise-of-contact-center-automation-in-12-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact Center Automation has risen in popularity<\/a> due to its ability to transform agent responsibilities entirely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Center Automation is the process of automating tier 1 customer service requests while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It represents the next generation of customer service operations where agent time is maximized to focus on conversations that require high empathy and creativity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With automation, agents rely on intelligent machines to fully resolve high-volume requests like order updates and account authentication, as well as back-office work like data entry and conversation analysis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation opens the door for customer service agents to learn new skills, earn higher wages, and find long-term engagement in their jobs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It forgoes the strategy of imploring agents to answer more calls, chats and texts for the entirety of their shifts. Instead, Contact Center Automation relieves them from their most taxing tasks, so they can focus only on conversations that provide the most value to their brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Customer Experiences<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What drives spikes in contact center demand? Traditionally, isolated events like seasonality, holidays, service outages, or product recalls result in outsized customer requests. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when we look at the trends of the last two years, we see a new culture-based customer service driver entering the fray.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers have grown accustomed to a new marketplace where one-touch service is the expectation. When they pick up the phone, or open a chat, they look forward to an immediate response that begins solving their problem instantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the heart of Contact Center Automation is this new customer persona. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers win with Contact Center Automation because it eliminates the causes that put \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/01\/business\/customer-service-pandemic-rage.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Nation on Hold<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, wait times become a thing of the past with automation, no matter what channel customers choose (important, as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conventional technologies like the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">telephone and email<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will account for 81.5% of the total contact center inbound interactions despite the advent of new channels).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple customer requests are resolved immediately with Contact Center Automation by intelligent machines that can achieve the same \u2013 or better \u2013 customer satisfaction scores as human agents. Built on conversational AI, automation allows customers to naturally state any number of requests, and interact with a machine as they would with a human all the way through resolution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, agents become more accessible for customers who truly need human assistance. Brands who adopt Contact Center Automation are already seeing the strategy pay dividends, as customers find their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6924696833915068416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">requests are being <strong>resolved<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0by intelligent machines, and not trapping them in a web of deflection tactics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Prepared Contact Centers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unpredictability in the contact center isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/the-consequences-of-rising-call-volumes-and-what-to-do-about-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">never been more prevalent<\/a>\u00a0between supply chain issues, ongoing pandemic challenges, and changing weather patterns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no better way to address unpredictability \u2013 not agent assist tools, not expanded self-service resources, not Business Process Outsourcing \u2013 than to automate every single inbound or outbound tier 1 customer interaction, 24\/7\/365, at unlimited scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation solutions can be deployed and begin answering phone calls and chat messages in weeks with integrations into virtually any CMS, CCaaS, or telephony system.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once implemented, it can provide accurate data and intelligent insights into what additional call flows it can automate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers essentially get a cost-effective, infinite supply of 5-star agents for tier 1 customer requests. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downstream, they can slash training and hiring costs, promise greater productivity and engagement to their agents, and focus on true long-term retention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for the next decade-plus, as data becomes the ultimate resource, contact centers can lean on a library of auto-transcribed customer interactions that help surface insights and improve their automation via machine learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies already employing the strategy have seen that this is not a solution offering a 10% increase in productivity or cost efficiency.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a complete transformation wherein customers, agents, and operations receive permanent relief to the demand, labor, and forecasting challenges of the last two years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The longer labor shortages persist in contact centers, the more choices operations and CX leaders will have to approach the problem.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers will need to think long-term to decide whether incremental improvements in internal communications, agent assist features, and self service options are enough to get them back to stability, or if true transformation is needed to increase their competitiveness in a customer-first world lacking enough reliable agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In either case, a new era of customer service is here. Brands who embrace Contact Center Automation first will be in the best position to capture the talent and customers who have long demanded it.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Get everything you need
