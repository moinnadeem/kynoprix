So how does IVR pricing stack up when it comes to customer service? Well, for decades customers have complained about traditional interactive voice response (IVR) systems. According to Forbes, customers say they have \u201cwasted their time and too rarely got them the information they sought.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many customers are sick and tired of dialogue management done through IVR. They try to bypass difficult IVR interactions, trying to get a live agent on the line by repeatedly pressing \u201c0\u201d or repeating \u201cspeak to agent\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, once AI is implemented, contact centers become much more effective for both customers and businesses. \u201cAI-enabled conversational assistants aren\u2019t just getting customers basic info they need; behind the scenes, they\u2019re also feeding human agents intelligent data and analysis to deliver better, faster outcomes, without customers ever being aware,\u201d the Forbes article explained.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are IVR systems?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an automated phone system technology, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/what-is-ivr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses pre-recorded messages to allow customers to ask questions or access information. It typically uses keypad selection or keywords that route callers to the information and answers they need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Expensive Is IVR Pricing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVR pricing tends to be relatively low, but you usually pay in the long run. In the past, many companies ran contact centers as inexpensively as possible. Though IVR seemed like the answer, it ended up frustrating customers and undermining their trust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most interactive voice response solutions don\u2019t work; they fail to eliminate wait times or resolve requests. Customers respond to IVR by simply trying to get out of \u201cbot land\u201d. Because customers want to talk to live agents, IVR doesn\u2019t do much to reduce agents\u2019 workloads. Even when customers get a live agent, they typically have to repeat personal information and questions before anything can be resolved. In the end, though it may be cheaper than other contact center solutions, most IVR systems waste hours of time for customers and call center agents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Looking at an IVR\u2019s Value<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have noticed decreased customer satisfaction resulting from poor interactive voice response systems. Yet, IVR solutions continue to be popular. The global market is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2026 according to a report by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220118005628\/en\/Global-Interactive-Voice-Response-Systems-Industry-to-2026---Speech-Enabled-IVR-Becoming-the-Preferred-User-Interface---ResearchAndMarkets.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BusinessWire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is, IVR pricing should be measured in more than dollars. Poor IVR customer service irritates customers and makes them more likely to leave a brand entirely. Agents\u2019 jobs are harder as they must deal with annoyed customers who have already wasted precious time talking to a bot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s hope. Just because interactive voice response solutions haven\u2019t worked well in the past doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re completely useless. When paired with contact center automation and conversational AI technology, IVR can become what it was meant to be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation and AI add much more value to a business by answering requests with no wait times over a variety of communication channels. Together with IVR, they accumulate millions in savings every year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Where Does AI Come In?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/ivr-made-customer-service-efficient-machine-learning-is-next-level-replicant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI reinforced IVR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the software can begin resolving requests the instant customers pick up the phone. AI eliminates the need for keywords, allowing customers to speak naturally and have a more enjoyable and effective experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI also knows its limits \u2013 when it can\u2019t handle a question, it hands the conversation over to an agent before frustrated customers start forcing their way through to a live staff member. When agents take up conversations, they have access to notes, auto-generated summaries, and other information so that customers don\u2019t have to repeat themselves every step of the way. This is just one of the types of conversational AI integrations that can bolster existing call center operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Try Replicant\u2019s Conversational IVR Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum it up, while standard IVR pricing can be relatively low and attractive, it can also be a frustrating solution for customers.
