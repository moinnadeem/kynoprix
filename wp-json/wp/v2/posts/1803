From there, contact centers can scale their solution to begin handling millions of live customer conversations in just weeks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation allows contact centers to think critically about their customer patterns and maximum ROI opportunities, rather than focusing on the intricacies of building a solution in-house \u2013 a process that can take months to years to accomplish, and often never is completed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long term, it gives organizations a whole new way to treat contact centers. They will no longer be a cost center but instead shift to centers of excellence able to gain new insights on the customer and their priorities. Ultimately contact centers are able to illuminate gaps in other areas of their business with Contact Center Automation, resulting in a 360-degree view of the customer and operating model at large.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a high-level roadmap for getting started:<\/p>\n<h2>Pre-Implementation<\/h2>\n<p><b>  Identify Use Cases<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation is not an all-or-nothing solution. Many contact centers deploy the solution in one-to-few use cases to start, like caller authentication or account management. Identify automation opportunities with use cases that are one or more of the following: high volume, often uncontained by IVR, prone to spikes, low-emotion, low-to-mid complexity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>  Calculate Expected ROI<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner with a solution provider onin a thorough discovery and documentation of metrics and goals to determine an accurate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/roi-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROI model<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Leverage existing customer data to recommend future use cases and build a business case for deployment. This is best achieved alongside an experienced partner with case studies for forecasting results against KPIs and initial costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>  Perform Technology Assessment<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bring together IT, CCaaS, and telephony stakeholders to generate a comprehensive assessment of your technology stack. Goals at this stage include aligning integrations, connecting with accurate data systems, and complying with your security and privacy standards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>  Conversation Design<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversation design defines the structure of communication, both functionally and technically, at all possible turns between a human and machine. This includes words said, situations, contexts, responses, entities, prompts, and more. Work with your partner to ensure every conversation is designed to resolve customer issues quickly and naturally over every channel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>  Go-Live and Testing<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once deployed, Contact Center Automation can begin resolving customer conversations with minimal training. At this stage, your solution partner should work with you to test conversations in a low-code conversational design studio. The more conversations automated, the smarter the technology will get as it begins to gather data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Post-implementation:<\/h2>\n<p><b>  Measure Results<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify the rate at which your chosen use cases are fully automated versus escalated to an agent. By starting with the percentage of issues that are automated and thus saving customer and agent time, you\u2019ll begin realizing your ROI and building a business case for further automation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  <\/span>Measure Performance<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation collects CSAT in real-time for every conversation, as well as granular data based on conversation transcripts. Map customer dispositions to automation outcomes and A\/B test scripts to ensure constant improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>  Start Scaling<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Center Automation scales to handle millions of autonomous calls concurrently. Use data-based improvement opportunities to offload more customer requests. As you automate more use cases and create efficiencies in your service flow, your ROI compounds while agents and customers thrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Ready for a deeper look into getting started with Contact Center Automation?
