Although some may choose to turn to traditional solutions such as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business process outsourcing (BPO) or legacy technologies like interactive voice response (IVR), others may want to explore some <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact center innovation ideas<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as conversational AI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executives are looking for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> call center solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that no longer depend on human agents as heavily, especially for Tier One questions and inquiries. They want solutions that can easily scale up and down with unpredictable volumes while providing added value at a cost-effective price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automation technologies such as machine learning, natural language understanding, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/intelligent-virtual-agent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intelligent virtual agent<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are growing in popularity as customer service climbs to one of the top fields for high attrition rates. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehrdirector.com\/how-to-survive-the-new-era-of-the-great-resignation-in-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one recent study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 45 percent of surveyed customer service agents are considering quitting within a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is call center outsourcing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call center outsourcing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also referred to as BPO, is the process of hiring a third-party vendor to provide supplemental staffing for contact centers. Many of these are offshore solutions and can be the most expensive method for adding talent as they have high training costs and attrition rates. They may lead to poor customer satisfaction and damage to a brand\u2019s reputation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are some trends for call center innovation in 2022?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the fact that many existing solutions such BPO, IVR, and other legacy-based systems have many shortcomings and weaknesses, contact center automation and conversational AI adoption are surfacing as <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successful call center management<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solutions in 2022. Machine-based learning and natural language processing systems can resolve Tier One requests faster with zero hold times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are common BPO disadvantages?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While contact center outsourcing providers add staff, they don\u2019t have unlimited capacities. Often, high premiums are charged once a certain number of live agents are taking calls for a single customer. BPOs frequently require exorbitant training cycles that can take weeks to months, and they can require rigid contracts that don\u2019t take into account seasonality or agent off-time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing in a BPO environment is often not feasible, which limits the vendor\u2019s ability to pivot quickly when key metrics are lagging. Compared with the agile capabilities of point-and-click AI solutions, BPO systems are slow to change. In addition, BPOs are also experiencing high attrition rates, as employees flock to gig economy jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can conversational AI solutions solve these problems?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conversational IVR<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solutions are driven by sophisticated machine learning technology, they can be trained once on a particular company\u2019s call center protocols and product and service lines. Furthermore, as the AI-driven solution takes calls, it learns more about inquiries, customer intents, and brand details, making it more effective as time goes on. No knowledge is lost when someone decides to resign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because conversational AI can detect multiple customer intents, it is capable of sophisticated <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dialogue management<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, resolving Tier One inquiries immediately with no hold times. Any particularly complex questions can be intelligently routed to the correct live agent along with the information that has already been gathered to eliminate customers needing to repeat their requests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI provides a consistent customer experience that represents a company\u2019s brand the same way every time and frequently improves customer satisfaction. For instance, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine solution delivers average CSAT scores that are equal to or better than human agents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What additional advantages does conversational AI solutions deliver?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, BPO solutions do not provide the data that contact centers need to improve performance. Conversational AI, on the other hand, delivers deep analytics that go beyond the traditional ones, providing contact center leaders with insight into new call flows to automate as well as more information about call types and patterns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Our Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re evaluating<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> remote call center solutions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, learn more about Replicant\u2019s<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/capabilities\/intelligent-virtual-agent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> intelligent virtual agent <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offering.
