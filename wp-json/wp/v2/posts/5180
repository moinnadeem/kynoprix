Winners were selected by the average scores of more than 170 professionals worldwide on seven specialized juries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gold, Silver, and Bronze Stevie Award placements from among the Finalists were revealed during the gala awards banquet in March at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, attended by more than 400 executives from around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s award \u2013 the Silver Stevie Award for a Contact Center Solution, New Version \u2013 recognized the impact of our 2022 omnichannel launch, which added SMS, and chat to our Contact Center Automation platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Omnichannel Automation Improves Customer Experiences<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 75% of consumers seek a consistent experience across multiple engagement channels \u2013 social media, mobile, online, in-person, or through the phone. A staggering 73% will likely change brands if they don\u2019t get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Replicant initially created AI-powered customer service for what has traditionally been the hardest channel to effectively automate \u2013 the phone \u2013 adding SMS and chat was always an obvious next step.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability for contact centers to now automate every channel using a single conversation engine has been instrumental in relieving agents and improving customer satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Resolve customer issues naturally across channels<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omnichannel automation allows contact centers to power their voice and messaging channels with a single conversation engine that leverages a shared intent library to deploy and scale conversational AI faster across languages and channels for every conversation flow. In other words, they can fully automate their most common customer service requests with a single solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Give customers a consistent experience across channels<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers can resolve issues naturally when and where their customers need it most with seamless channel switching across voice, messaging, and other digital channels. Contact Center Automation can share conversational context across channels, so that customers don\u2019t need to repeat themselves when they switch from SMS, to voice, or vice versa. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact centers can use customizable FlexForms to easily switch from voice to SMS and collect information faster. And with channel-specific NLU, customers get accuracy for understanding communication like emojis and misspellings in text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Visualize conversations across channels in a single dashboard<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center managers don\u2019t just need holistic automation options \u2013 they need a solution for disparate data sources per channel. Replicant omnichannel automation allows leaders to view conversation transcripts for every customer interaction, across all channels, in a single dashboard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With every conversation, our Thinking Machine automatically generates transcripts and makes them available for live monitoring within a single dashboard. Managers can quickly find actionable insights into omnichannel conversations with advanced analytics, and take action to optimize customer experiences.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Handoff escalations seamlessly to live agents<br \/>\n<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Omnichannel automation is only as good as its ability to relieve agents from repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Replicant integrates seamlessly with live agent platforms to handoff complex issues that require human empathy without losing customer context. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This benefits both agents and customers: agents get full context into every escalation using their existing platforms, no matter the channel, and customers receive a unified experience. And with API integrations to all existing data systems, Replicant can leverage customer data stores for a personalized experience across channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About the Stevie Awards<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stevie Awards are conferred in eight programs: the Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards, the German Stevie Awards, The American Business Awards\u00ae, The International Business Awards\u00ae, the Middle East &amp; North Africa Stevie Awards, the Stevie Awards for Women in Business, the Stevie Awards for Great Employers, and the Stevie Awards for Sales &amp; Customer Service.
