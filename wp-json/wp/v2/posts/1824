They must be maintained, adapt to their users, and, every so often, undergo some remodeling. For years, contact centers have been trying to accomplish all of these tasks by implementing automation to save customers time and modernize experiences. But up until now, they\u2019ve had to lay a foundation brick by brick, and channel-by-channel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, contact centers provide a service that can\u2019t be shut down for construction \u2013 they must remain open 24\/7, no matter what\u2019s being built or replaced. This means that an ad-hoc approach to automation \u2013 piecing together standalone solutions offered by several disparate vendors \u2013 often results in customers receiving disjointed experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where they may expect one process over the phone \u2013 say, stating their zip code to verify their identity \u2013 they may find an entirely different process over text, like having to hunt down an account number they\u2019ve never used just to receive service. Customers have gotten used to hearing \u201cplease listen closely as our menu options have changed\u201d for years on end.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact centers, laying the foundation for an automation strategy has created a never-ending game of cat and mouse, where managers are constantly evaluating separate vendors and taking on expensive, time-consuming projects in an attempt to automate common customer service requests across each channel. In the end, they only see marginal productivity gains, if any.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pitfalls of using disparate automation vendors can disrupt everything \u2013\u00a0from customer experiences to years of technology roadmapping. Here\u2019s how:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem #1: Customers get frustrated<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers deal with hundreds of different contact centers every year. Within a single brand, however, they expect a consistent experience that doesn\u2019t waver in its usability. When they don\u2019t receive it, they\u2019re quick to question the value of a brand, and the stats show it.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">49% of consumers, on average, use three to five different communication channels to contact customer service. (Microsoft Dynamics 365, 2020) Source<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">89% of customers are retained by companies with strong omnichannel customer engagement. (Invesp, 2019)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% of consumers look forward to a consistent experience across multiple engagement channels\u2013social media, mobile, online, in-person, or through the phone. 73% will likely change brands if they don\u2019t get it.

On the contrary, Replicant focused on building Contact Center Automation that\u2019s purpose-built for voice first to address the fact that while 76% of customers prefer placing a phone call to contact customer service, it remains the most frustrating automated customer experience out of all the channels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past few years, we have perfected our AI platform to offer the most natural human-to-machine\u00a0 conversations ever crafted. In the last few years alone, Replicant\u2019s Thinking Machine has automated over 30 million calls for some of the world\u2019s largest and most beloved brands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the same conversation engine that finally cracked the code on voice powers a full Contact Center Automation platform \u2013 one that can resolve issues across voice, messaging, and other digital channels. This gives contact centers the brand-new ability to partner with a solution that finally prioritizes Voice. Leaders can now rely on a single, integrated solution to automate across all channels in any language regardless if it&#8217;s voice or messaging.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem #3: Data gets lost\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most damaging impacts of a standalone, channel-by-channel automation strategy is the risk of data loss. Without a unified protocol for retrieving and viewing data, contact centers are unable to understand their total customer experience by means of data. Replicant allows contact center managers to visualize conversations across channels in a single dashboard. They can view conversation transcripts for every customer interaction, across all channels in an end-to-end dashboard that lets contact center managers monitor conversations, analyze insights from conversation data, and take action immediately by updating conversation scripts to create an optimal customer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/replicant-announces-expanded-support-across-messaging-and-digital-channels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>READ: Introducing Omnichannel Contact Center Automation<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem #4: Timelines are off sync\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standalone, channel-by-channel automation strategies can take years, without ever fully being implemented or showing a return on investment. This creates enormous risk when partnering with a new vendor, as project timelines get reshuffled as new market challenges arise, like that of the past two years with the pandemic and great resignation. It can also destabilize siloed channels, as customers deal with new rollouts and more software bugs. With Replicant, contact centers can scale the best of conversational design across every conversation flow with Replicant Powers \u2013 pre-built components that make it easy to design optimal conversations without heavy development. They can also seamlessly integrate with existing agent workflows and contact center and CRM software to automatically handle escalations, create cases, log summary notes, and resolve tickets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem #5: Agents suffer\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piecemeal automation approaches lead to tool fragmentation for agents requiring them to learn new, disjointed technologies and high operational overhead for call center and IT teams who bring the implementations together. But more importantly, they don\u2019t solve agents\u2019 biggest problem: there\u2019s not enough of them to answer every call, chat and text. With Contact Center Automation, agents team up with a solution that can <\/span><b>fully resolve <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">repetitive, tier 1 requests that make up the bulk of their workload.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to see why so many contact centers have struggled to achieve true digital transformation with automation at the forefront given the lack of options they\u2019ve had access to. With Replicant, contact centers can finally break out of the insurmountable challenge that is piecemeal, standalone automation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s AI platform allows consumers to engage in natural conversations across voice, messaging and other digital channels to resolve their customer support issues. It provides an out-of-the-box foundation that scales up or down instantly, can be implemented in weeks and handles millions of customer support interactions a month.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, it safeguards against channel-by-channel automation deployments that can end up costing businesses millions of dollars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Replicant, contact centers finally have the ability to holistically transform their customer service experience, while avoiding the common pitfalls of standalone, disparate automation solutions:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Read the full press release or download the guide for more information on our omnichannel features. <a
