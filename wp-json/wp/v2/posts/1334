Whether it\u2019s through using speech recognition to communicate, visual perception to recognize objects, or predictive analytics to identify and understand patterns in data, AI aims to simulate human-like qualities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bernardmarr\/2018\/02\/14\/the-key-definitions-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-that-explain-its-importance\/#59d968c94f5d\">Forbes<\/a> author Bernard Marr wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a primary objective for most to get to AI that operates just like a human brain, but to use its unique capabilities to enhance our world.\u201d AI is not meant to just mimic human capabilities, but to improve them as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Voice AI<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Voice AI allows humans to use their natural voice as an interface to ask questions of, give commands to, and perform tasks to communicate with machines. Today, voice activated machines can intake voice dictation, interpret it and execute short commands to reply to users. Humans are becoming more comfortable using their voice to interact with technology as devices like Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and Google\u2019s Home Assistant gain traction. Voice is also the fastest and most interactive way to communicate with customers when it comes to customer service, but it\u2019s difficult to scale as it usually means relying on call centers for high touch customer service. See how voice AI provides an opportunity to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/conversational-ai-brings-new-experiences-to-customer-service\/\">reimagine customer service<\/a> for call centers with greater efficiency and scale.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conversational AI<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Conversational AI is often used interchangeably with Voice AI and typically describes chatbots. <a href=\"https:\/\/chatbotsmagazine.com\/the-complete-beginner-s-guide-to-chatbots-8280b7b906ca\">Chatbot magazine<\/a> states, \u201cA chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface.\u201d Chatbots are generally designed with a defined purpose, whether that be helping a customer purchase a product, scheduling an appointment, or simply having \u201csomeone\u201d to chat with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We like to think of conversational AI as much more than just chatbots. Conversational AI is voice AI plus more &#8211; the more being the added element of natural, human-like conversations that make interactions with machines flexible. In order to have a conversation, a machine must be able to discuss back and forth with many turns, express thoughts, understand multiple intents and share contextual information. These qualities are what make human to machine communications \u201cconversational\u201d.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-922\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Canva-Voice-assistant.-Woman-recording-message-using-cellphone-1024x608.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Digital Assistants<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Digital assistants, otherwise known as \u201cintelligent assistants\u201d are computer programs designed to assist a user by answering questions and performing basic tasks. Humans can place an order, check the weather, or set a timer with digital assistants. Some examples of digital assistants include Amazon Alexa and Google Home Assistant for consumers and Microsoft Cortana for enterprise users. Voice assistants built into our mobile experiences such as Apple\u2019s Siri or Android\u2019s Mycroft can also be labeled as digital assistants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In a study conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/services\/consulting\/library\/consumer-intelligence-series\/voice-assistants.html\">PwC<\/a>, it was discovered that 18-24 year-olds have been the fastest to adopt and experiment with new voice technology features. Surprisingly, 25-49 year-olds utilize voice technology the most, and 65% of this demographic use voice devices once per day. Digital assistants have become widespread in our consumer lives and are setting the stage for fast adoption of voice AI and conversational AI in other areas of our lives like customer service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-921\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Canva-Hong-Kong-China-11-March-2018_-Physical-microphone-switch-button-of-the-Google-Home-Mini-Chalk-color-on-a-wooden-surface..jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Interactive Virtual Assistants (IVA\u2019s)<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>IVR\u2019s are computers that use menu dialog systems to assist humans through voice and keypad recognition. Oftentimes they\u2019re used in customer service calls and attempt to direct customers to the right agents, sometimes offering limited self-service capabilities. IVA\u2019s are an evolution of the IVR with slightly more emotive characteristics. IVA\u2019s make it \u201ceasier\u201d to talk to the computer as you would a person by using aspects of conversational AI and voice AI. These solutions have come a long way but still have <a href=\"https:\/\/electronics.howstuffworks.com\/interactive-voice-response4.htm\">limitations<\/a> when it comes to meeting the expectations of customer service which is why we\u2019re so excited about upcoming advancements in conversational AI.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Virtual Agents<\/strong><\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual agent is an AI technology that\u2019s designed to mimic the abilities of a human agent. This form of conversational AI is widely used for customer service. This term is occasionally used to describe a human agent that works remotely, but in the AI industry, you will almost always see it referring to a machine agent.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uctoday.com\/contact-centre\/what-is-a-virtual-agent\/\">UCtoday <\/a>describes, virtual agents \u201cgo a step further by performing advanced customer service functions like giving customers recommendations. They can even answer FAQs, and help them find information needed to satisfy the reason they contacted support in the first place.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Key benefits of virtual agents:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cost-efficient<\/li>\r\n<li>Provide 24\/7 service<\/li>\r\n<li>Relieves human agents of overload by solving repetitive, Tier-1 customer issues<\/li>\r\n<li>Understands and records customer data<\/li>\r\n<li>Uses conversational AI for a human-like effect<\/li>\r\n<li>Trainable and consistent<\/li>\r\n<li>\u201cLearns\u201d and becomes more efficient over time<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com\/definition\/virtual-agent\">Essentially<\/a>, this technology can provide basic information to customers or employees, help guide the users through questions, and automatically reroute complex conversations or issues to an actual human agent if needed.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>AI is a cutting-edge technology that\u2019s quickly integrating into our daily lives, especially when it comes to digital assistants and customer service.
