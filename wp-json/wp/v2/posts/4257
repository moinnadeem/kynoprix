Automation solves immediate problems<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/benchmark-report-contact-center-automation-is-moving-to-the-mainstream\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 Benchmark Report<\/a> found that most contact center leaders (95%) have either already adopted, are implementing now, or are planning to implement automation within the next year. Resolve reinforced that trend with story after story from CX leaders inundated by unpredictable call spikes without possessing the necessary headcount to field each request. With agents hard to come by and demand hard to plan for, Contact Center Automation is an ideal solution due to its ability to fully resolve common issues \u2013 not just route or deflect them like previous solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. The future of contact centers is hybrid<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/definitive-guide-to-contact-center-automation\/\">Contact Center Automation<\/a> places an emphasis on a multi-pronged approach to customer service \u2013 one where humans and machines work in tandem to assist customers. A hallmark of this model is the division of request types. Automation provides end-to-end support for common, high-volume requests that are prone to spikes and allows humans to be more available for urgent or complex requests that require human creativity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Analytics drive customer experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact center leaders are looking for solutions that don\u2019t just relieve agents of demand, but also help them better understand their customers\u2019 preferences. For example, an automation solution with rich insights and transcription can not just increase resolutions, but also help leaders find better ways to design conversations and respond to different kinds of unstructured speech.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4259 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Hosted by Replicant, Resolve 2022 is where contact center leaders and innovators come together to explore what\u2019s possible.\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_1870-1300x867.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Component-driven design makes AI easier<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key part of the discussion around today\u2019s unpredictable contact center climate was the need for fast, frictionless automation projects. That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/contact-center-automation\/features\/\">Replicant<\/a> rolled out a roadmap of additional automation flows built on deployment-ready components. These flows make it easier than ever to achieve a live solution, while making integrations and continuous learning a breeze.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. \u201cConversation Design\u201d is top-of-mind<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversation design plays a huge role in how effective an automation flow is. <em>Resolve<\/em> highlighted many of the best practices that contribute to a delightful conversation. For example, the ability to offer an eye exam when a customer cites blurry vision, or the ability to infer that a customer needs to make a policy change when they state they have a new car.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/blog\/resolve-2022-9-tips-to-design-automated-conversations-that-actually-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>READ:\u00a09 Tips to Design Automated Conversations That Actually Work<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Leaders are focusing on change management\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a panel led by AAA and Canadian Auto Association, the importance of change management was stressed as a key driver behind the value they gained from Replicant. At both insurers, a strong collaboration between operational teams and frontline associates helped their agents understand the benefits of automation, while providing better experiences for members with every call.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt&#8217;s not about replacing our team members&#8217; jobs, it&#8217;s allowing them to use their analytical skills to the best of their abilities and automating some of the mundane tasks.\u201d Lisa Rivier, Senior Director of Operations, AAA\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Start-and-scale is a preferred strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When leading financial services company ECSI began using Replicant to automate customer interactions, they didn\u2019t try to boil the ocean. Like many innovative brands, they started small. Every contact center has a handful of straightforward call types that eat up large volumes of agent time. Starting with just one use case allows leaders to realize value faster and scale to more flow types based on data and need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Deflection is a poor outcome<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees from every industry were no longer interested in automated solutions that ultimately deflect the majority of callers to areas of self-service like apps or websites. In fact, they\u2019ve found these types of solutions merely lower handle times by creating frustrated customers who feel as though their time was wasted with an ineffective call tree. Instead, first contact resolution (FCR) is a more important outcome for leaders seeking transformative automation solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4260 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.replicant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0155-1300x866.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. The \u201chappy path\u201d is only the beginning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many contact center leaders have been a part of build-it-yourself automation projects. But a common roadblock they\u2019ve faced is that the ideal conversation flow is usually not the most frequent result. In other words, effective automation requires AI with continuous improvement so that it can learn from every call automatically and be prepared for more diverse patterns of speech (one of the reasons Replicant comes pre-trained on millions of calls so you don\u2019t need to wait years to achieve optimum results).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Containment isn\u2019t everything<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as deflection can have a negative effect on customer satisfaction, containment is no longer a leading indicator of good CX. Instead, leaders are choosing automation solutions that don\u2019t trap customers in an automation loop. Customers who need an agent should get transferred to one as efficiently as possible, and Contact Center Automation is able to gather initial information and pass complex requests to agents with full context so customers don\u2019t have to repeat themselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In just the last year, contact center leaders have faced mounting pressure from a tightening&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":4258,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[45],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.2 (Yoast SEO v21.2) -
