But as questions continue around the immediate future of the economy, customer service can play a key role in creating a future-proof business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>According to Harvard Business Review, increasing customer retention rates by just 5%\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">increases profits<\/a>\u00a0by 25% to 95%, and loyalty leaders\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/01\/are-you-undervaluing-your-customers?ab=at_art_art_1x1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">grow revenues<\/a>\u00a0roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For contact center leaders, it\u2019s often wasted energy to try to nail down if and when a recession will happen, how long it will last, and when things might rebound. Instead, contact center leaders can focus on protecting against uncertainty while securing future success with these 10 best practices in mind. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong> The full checklist can be downloaded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/resources\/guide\/checklist-10-steps-to-recession-proofing-a-contact-center\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>1. Identify long-term priorities in a vacuum<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recessions don\u2019t last forever. Contact center leaders who remain focused on customer-centric priorities, regardless of the economic environment, will help protect their brands\u2019 competitiveness for the long haul. Digital transformation, for example, is one priority <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/how-to-survive-a-recession-and-thrive-afterward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experts say<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can \u201chelp management better understand their business, how the recession is affecting it, and where there\u2019s potential for operational improvements.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Analyze gaps in the customer journey<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before forming a holistic recession strategy, unpack your customer journey and identify actionable weak spots. What are your least effective channels? How do your customers place orders, submit claims, or update information? What call flows lead to the highest abandonment rates? Take specific note of customer touchpoints that lead to the weakest results. These will be your most valuable focus areas.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Drive loyalty by improving CX<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">76% of consumers say a poor customer experience <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/blog\/survey-the-effects-of-bad-customer-service-and-how-brands-can-fix-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">negatively impacts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their perception of a brand and one in three say it affects loyalty. On the other hand, increasing customer retention rates by 5% can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase profits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by 25% to 95% and grow revenues even faster. After identifying gaps in a customer journey, contact centers should look to improve existing experiences for even the most loyal customers. This step can help create brand evangelists and boost loyalty even if customers become more selective with their spending.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Increase reach with omnichannel<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 out of 10 consumers want an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">omnichannel experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with seamless service between communication channels and 89% of customers are retained when they receive it. Consistent omnichannel experiences not only make it more convenient for customers to get their issues resolved, but also drive greater efficiency with features like SMS forms, which can capture information faster and drive down average handle times.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Increase agent retention<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the pandemic, 96% of agents felt <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calabrio.com\/wfo\/workforce-engagement-management\/what-agents-want-in-the-era-of-the-great-resignation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acutely stressed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least once a week. Almost half cited \u2018too many calls\u2019 as their biggest challenge. Contact center managers know how hard it is to hire and retain talented agents today, but increasing agent engagement is a proven method of retention. Look to invest in solutions that can offload the repetitive, tier-1 calls that flood agents, and enable them to focus on requests that require empathy and creativity.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Scale service with flexibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unexpected surges in call volumes can lead to extended hold times and overwhelmed queues. While in past years, contact centers could simply hire more agents or leverage Business Process Outsourcing during busy seasons, the high cost of these approaches make them unrealistic in a recession. Contact centers should instead invest in flexible solutions that can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/customer\/ecsi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scale<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide support during overflow events, after-hours or\u00a0 seasonal holidays.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Invest in technology with compounding ROI<\/h2>\n<p><b> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like contact centers themselves should scale with customer demand, their technology should also be scalable with their own long-term growth plans. Contact centers should look to solutions that can make an immediate impact, but also offer compounded ROI as adoption increases over time. Contact Center Automation, for example, is a future-friendly solution that starts offering relief by automating resolutions to common customer service questions like \u201cwhere is my order?\u201d and can expand to more complex call flows like payment and billing issues over time.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>8. Become more composable<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> summarizes composability as \u201ccreating an organization made from interchangeable building blocks.\u201d They also note that composable thinking enables a business to \u201csurvive, and even flourish, in times of great disruption.\u201d For contact centers, composability means leveraging APIs and containers in order to enable separate systems like CCaaS, CRM and automation to work in harmony. It also means partnering with solutions that can integrate with any combination of common platforms, as well as self-built systems.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>9. Increase efficiency sooner<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> During the 2009 recession, studies have shown that the most resilient companies reduced costs and increased operating efficiencies <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/what-companies-should-do-to-prepare-for-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than their competitors. Contact centers can adopt a similar strategy with \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2019\/05\/how-to-survive-a-recession-and-thrive-afterward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-funding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d transformation projects that pay off quickly, such as automating common customer service interactions. These technologies bring transformation beyond the incremental improvements of traditional solutions like IVRs and agent assist tools. Eventually, they can replace legacy technologies and impact the bottom line even further.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>10. Deploy Contact Center Automation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Contact Center Automation is a modern solution built for modern challenges. Powered by conversational AI, Contact Center Automation can achieve every step of a recession-proof roadmap while providing customers with exceptional service. Companies can automate their most common customer service requests while empowering agents to focus on more complex and nuanced customer challenges. Adopting Contact Center Automation can help reduce costs, while increasing CSAT, customer loyalty, agent engagement, and contact center flexibility.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"om-ou5hbocxwkn476jzlkv0-holder\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Extended periods of economic uncertainty are inherently speculative.
