It\u2019s time to do customer service differently.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this ebook, explore how consumer behavior is reshaping customer service and how taking an elastic customer service approach with autonomous contact center capabilities can equip you to not only meet these expectations, but improve the customer experience overall \u2014 and retain your customers.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Online shopping is here to stay<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With stores closed, lockdowns, and social distancing practices in place, many shoppers turned to online shopping. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/shopify-five-leading-retail-trends-2021-are\">84%<\/a> of consumers have shopped online since the pandemic, with <a href=\"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/shopify-five-leading-retail-trends-2021-are\">65%<\/a> having shopped in store. What\u2019s more is that <a href=\"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/shopify-five-leading-retail-trends-2021-are\">79%<\/a> say they will shop online regularly in the next six months, while only <a href=\"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/shopify-five-leading-retail-trends-2021-are\">57%<\/a> say they\u2019ll shop regularly in store. 2021 brings the promise of recovery, but it carries most of the same consumer behaviors with it.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in online shopping volume puts pressure on contact centers as agents effectively take the place of in store sales associates in assisting consumers through the buying process.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selligent.com\/connectedconsumer?utm_campaign=consumer_index_2020&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=homepage_resource\">59% <\/a>of consumers contact customer service now to get help making a purchase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is in addition to handling all the routine customer service inquiries and issues. This massive uptick in call volume as well as the sheer unpredictability of when spikes and surges will arise, leaves contact centers maxed out. Consequently, long hold times or lack of responsiveness create negative customer experiences that induce churn.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to ecommerce, retailers that also have brick-and-mortar stores must maintain high levels of positive CX in store, and connect the consumer experience across every touchpoint: in store, website, app, marketing, and customer service. While retailers cannot take their eye off of ecommerce, for many it\u2019s just one more piece of an already complex omnichannel customer experience.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New delivery options are now the norm<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Contactless shopping, curbside delivery, and buy-online-pick-up-instore (BOPIS) were initially ways to adapt to shutdowns and restrictions. But buyers have grown accustomed to the convenience of these services and expect stores to continue to provide them into the future.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.selligent.com\/connectedconsumer?utm_campaign=consumer_index_2020&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=homepage_resource\">72%<\/a> of Americans say contactless pick-up is important to them<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.selligent.com\/connectedconsumer?utm_campaign=consumer_index_2020&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=homepage_resource\">69%<\/a> value curbside pick-up options<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These trends require a closer connection between online ordering, delivery, and customer support \u2014 and result in an increase in customers contacting customer service with Tier-1 questions about orders, pickup times and order status updates.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even with automated systems communicating this information to customers, many still have questions and contact support to resolve them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increased returns adds pressure<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As shoppers have transitioned to online shopping for items they normally would have tried on or evaluated for themselves in store, the rate of returns has understandably increased.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, digital purchases were forecasted to increase by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mytotalretail.com\/article\/bracing-for-the-returns-avalanche\/\">35.8%<\/a> in 2020, reaching $190 billion for November and December combined, resulting in the value of returns being estimated to touch $57 billion. It is estimated that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mytotalretail.com\/article\/bracing-for-the-returns-avalanche\/\">70%<\/a> of consumers make purchases now based on a retailer\u2019s return policy, and 60% expect returns to be handled within seven days.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Who handles these returns? While there are multiple teams involved throughout the complex return process, for the consumer, returns start and end with customer service.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The massive volume of returns incurs steep costs and time, with the potential to jeopardize margins for retailers already hard hit by economic uncertainty.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All of these shifts mean that customer service agents are bearing the weight of a much heavier load than they have in decades.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Faster, smarter digital customer support<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Given the added pressure on agents, it would seem cruel to inform contact centers that they must now work faster and step up their already stretched-thin game. But, customer expectations lead when it comes to how businesses differentiate themselves in this age.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.selligent.com\/connectedconsumer?utm_campaign=consumer_index_2020&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=homepage_resource\">93%<\/a> of consumers expect a response within 24 hours<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.selligent.com\/connectedconsumer?utm_campaign=consumer_index_2020&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=homepage_resource\">89%<\/a> expect a resolution within 24 hours<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Customers go where they get the best customer experience. Their loyalty is not to brands, but to how brands make them feel. And, they have little forgiveness for when brands are too slow or fail to respond when they contact customer service.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Contact centers are at an inflection point where they must find alternative ways of delivering exceptional customer care or risk losing customers and revenue to competitors that do.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Autonomous contact centers can do the heavy lifting<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that as contact center and CX leaders strive to address these growing demands on customer service, automation and AI come into the scene. In fact, AI-driven automation solutions abound. Many enable contact centers to use chatbots and automated notifications and updates, as well as lift the burden of after call work for agents; but few offer what is critically needed: an extra pair of hands without hiring or outsourcing another agent.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An autonomous contact center solution provides elasticity for contact centers \u2014 enabling them to stretch up and down without adding cost, staffing more agents, or having to make fine-tuned forecasts for scheduling. By offering true elasticity, autonomous contact center solutions, like Replicant Voice, lift all the work of Tier-1 calls off of agents\u2019 shoulders and answer every call, no matter what is happening. They resolve up to 90% of Tier-1 issues, and if needed provide agents with auto-generated call summaries prior to escalation. This means that customers with common, routine questions and issues always get resolution on first contact.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s like adding a massive amount of staff without ever having to do so, at 50% the cost. And, it frees agents up to focus on calls that require an emotional connection and more complex resolution skills.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adopting an autonomous contact center<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When retailers adopt an autonomous contact center, they experience the following benefits:\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Give every shopper personal and proactive service<\/strong>: Authenticate callers and know what they\u2019re calling about to make every shopping experience more personal. Automatically detect satisfaction and send happy shoppers upsell offers and dissatisfied shoppers discounts via SMS to increase retention. Want to keep customers informed? Provide them with a brand ambassador to get store updates or the latest promotions based on their past purchase behaviors instantly. Tailor call scripts and A\/B test them to ensure that every conversation is consistent and on-brand.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Provide shoppers with accurate and fast responses<\/strong>: Give customers a number they can call to get resolutions anytime, anywhere and remove the burden from agents by letting the autonomous contact center resolve tier-1 customer service issues 24\/7.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Streamline shoppers most common service requests<\/strong>: Give shoppers faster resolutions to their most common service needs like delivery status updates, account updates, or return processing with interactive and intelligent voice-AI driven conversations. Make self-service easier by providing shoppers with downloadable return labels or their nearest fedex locations via SMS to reduce time to resolution while on the phone.\u00a0<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Elastically scale customer service to meet shopper demand<\/strong>: With more shoppers moving online, it\u2019s more important than ever to deliver consistent customer service experiences across every channel, 24\/7.
