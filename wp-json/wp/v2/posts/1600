Every company strives for providing an excellent customer experience. As consumers, we all expect high levels of service in our world of immediate gratification.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However in reality, providing innovative customer service can be a significant challenge. Top customer service challenges include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the current labor shortage (with more than 65,000 call center jobs open),<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ebbs and flows in call center traffic, and<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the complexity of the organization itself.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence technology has developed to a point where it can be leveraged as an innovative customer service solution. Using natural language processing, customers can ask a question as if they were talking to a human being. The best conversational AI solution will process the question and answer it correctly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/product-features\/thinking-machine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thinking Machine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can process different customer intents and questions more easily than other solutions. The longer it is a part of your call center, the more it \u201clearns\u201d what type of questions and requests come in. It teaches itself how to process questions better and respond to them in the best way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is excellent customer service?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of excellent customer service is simple: eliminate hold times and resolve issues quickly. However, getting there can be a little more difficult. Conversational AI can help you move in the right direction and reduce handling times. Simple questions can be answered automatically, 24\/7, while complex requests can be rapidly routed to the right person.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How does artificial intelligence improve customer service?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence that uses natural language processing allows customers to speak naturally. It eliminates the need to repeat the same information. As the system \u201clearns\u201d typical caller requests, it will be able to answer more and more questions automatically, resolving customer service challenges with zero hold times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of Data<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovative customer service starts with data and, in the case of contact centers, that data comes from customer questions, requests, and conversations. Each customer conversation holds valuable information about what clients are most confused or concerned about, providing you with important nuggets of information to improve not only your call center but your entire product or service line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI can transcribe every conversation and automatically surface insights to show what your customers are asking, what trends are arising, and what your contact center must do to serve customers better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of Time<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time is such a valued commodity for both your organization\u2019s call center as well as for your customers who are reaching out. According to MarketWatch, the average American will spend\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-average-american-will-spend-43-days-of-his-life-on-hold-2016-02-04\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43 days on hold<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout their lifetime.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI technolgy is an innovative way to eliminate hold times. By automating all your Tier One requests, you can respond to common questions and inquiries quickly and efficiently, saving your customers and representatives valuable time. In addition, your agents will be free to focus their attention on more complex calls that will also be more interesting and challenging to address.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some organizations falsely believe that the best way to find the right conversational AI solution is to create a customized one. However, this technology can be challenging to develop and maintain. Rely instead on a third-party partner who specializes in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Phone Calls Still Popular<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the growing popularity of text messaging, webchats, and other online communication methods, many people still prefer interacting by phone with customer service representatives. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/call-center-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by FinancesOnline.com indicates that the majority of people still prefer voice contact for customer service requests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI technology is getting so human-like that it\u2019s more and more difficult to decipher whether you are speaking with a computer or a person. Customers are willing to interact with a computerized system if that means reduced wait times and expedient answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Replicant\u2019s Customer Service Solution<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replicant\u2019sThinking Machine is a natural-language customer service solution.
