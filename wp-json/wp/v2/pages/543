Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information if compelled to do so under law, in a judicial or other governmental investigation or proceeding, provided that, to the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prior notice and reasonable assistance to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to and\/or limit the judicial or governmental requirement to disclosure. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all information of a party disclosed to the other party, regardless of the form of disclosure, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including without limitation and without the need to designate as confidential, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>Exceptions.

Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Replicant and its officers, directors, consultants, employees, successors and permitted assigns, from and against any third party claim, suit or proceeding and all resulting damages, costs, losses, awards and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees (collectively, a \u201cClaim\u201d), arising out of or relating to (a) the use or display of any Customer Content; (b) Customer\u2019s breach of its warranties under Section 6.1 of this Agreement; or (c) Customer\u2019s use of the Replicant Service in any manner that violates this Agreement or applicable laws, rules or regulations.<\/li>\n<li>Replicant\u2019s Indemnities.

Either party may terminate this Agreement (i) for the other party\u2019s material breach by giving written notice to the other party specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective 30 days after receipt of such notice unless the breaching party first cures such breach or (ii) if the other party is judged bankrupt or insolvent, makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, a trustee or receiver is appointed for such party or any petition by or on behalf of such party is filed under any bankruptcy or similar laws.<\/li>\n<li>Effect of Termination. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer will immediately cease use of the Replicant Service and each party shall return to the other party or destroy all of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information then in its possession, provided however, that customer may retain an archival copy of such data in its backup systems as required by its security and data retention policies or as required by applicable law.

In the event of such an amendment, Replicant will notify Customer of such update via email and provide Customer 30 days to object to such amendment. If Customer does not object within such period, the amended terms will be effective with respect to Customer upon the end thereof. If Customer does object, the terms in effect immediately prior to such amendment will remain in effect until the end of the then-current Subscription Term, and the amended terms will go into effect upon the beginning of the next Subscription Term, if the agreement is renewed pursuant to the terms of the Service Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>Governing law.
